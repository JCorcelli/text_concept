I thought of a gritty dissection of emotional motivation for learning but I think it's more subjective than I like so here's a dissection of myself instead.

There's the question that plagued educators. Why can't we teach people to think?

The answer is simple. Formal education does not teach people to think for themselves, it teaches people values while they try to practice various methods of learning at whatever pace was formally introduced.

What does it mean? What does this have to do with video games anyway?

All education is formal, so if video games educate they are formal education.  The difference is pacing is entirely free, meaning people don't play unless they feel like it.

Next there's been a question about why original idea are less common than remake in entertainment.  Well quite frankly, dear reader, original ideas are invented, and the invention can't be taught because it's about ignoring education and trying what you don't know.
