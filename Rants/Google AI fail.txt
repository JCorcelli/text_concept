They obviously screwed up. It does nothing extraordinary that a normal algorithm can't do. So am I supposed to accept that people are going to keep passing this garbage off as sci-fi becoming reality? If technology progresses at the speed of one programmer, you don't have an AI. You have a shit marketing team who don't understand how to program. And a group of pornstars willing to shill and face the camera like they love it, because it's an inborn talent and not something forced on them. What have we learned from this AI, it's a bot, that's what I learned, and this keeps getting reinforced by the uninformed responses it keeps making.
