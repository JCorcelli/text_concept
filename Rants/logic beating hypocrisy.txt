Now you know the difference between someone who writes fiction and someone who practicies real world violence. So make a choice, do you prefer to be gunned down by a complete stranger who owns rifles, and after executing them, find someone else to blame, or something ubiquitous? The initial problem was a child, just like everyone else in the community. Or do you prefer a problem solver who comes up with real answers to what's wrong? The initial problem was the community.

The real life example is Colombine. If everyone owns a gun in Texas, suddenly declaring media the reason people owns guns is, well, you sound stupid. Media declaring media the reason people owns guns is blatant propaganda. If it's for no reason but money, money is worthless when nobody's going to accept it.

Regardless of an answer, freedom of speech prevents claims from sending someone straight to jail. Someone like me, the problem solver, would have incentive to target problem communities. Freedom of speech is one of those laws that limits power. A freedom to say the wrong thing is freedom to be wrong, or lie outright.

I understand writing something down isn't active speech. And then if speech were interpreted as action the lie would be treasonous. It wouldn't take very long to put any news out of business online.

Imagine a boot kicking straight upwards into the face of god for all eternity. That is logic defeating hypocrisy.
