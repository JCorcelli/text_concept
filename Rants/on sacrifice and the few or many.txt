It's cynical to think mob mentality is set to deliberately hold back civilization by sacrificing the few. It is a fact that we can differentiate punishment from help. The people who use failure as punishment are on a fine line between corporal, judicial, and merit-based injustice.

It's ultimate pessemism to believe that throughout human history we sacrificed the few to make life worse for the many. It happened.

From an immature viewpoint I had for a limited time around age twelve, the reason was simple to deduce. A country at war need not feed dead soldiers. They had no technology to farm, they couldn't manage their resources, land was the measure for how many people could live.

Recent history lessons I've heard suggest there's more to it. Going to war was also profitable.

It has to backfire. I really think that putting a monetary value on how miserable people are is going to backfire. All money represents is goods and services. Money represented goods during initial bartering times, service was free, for people of a higher caste.

Monetized social value is faking the value of life. Life and time are pretty similar according to a human's perspective, they aren't, according to nature.
