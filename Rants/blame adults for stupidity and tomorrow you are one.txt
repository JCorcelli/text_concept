I have a new explanation of things.

I don't mind repeatedly stating there are smarter people than me. There is always someone better at a given topic.

I see society encouraging intelligent people to practice stupidity. I see young education systems encouraging disreputable information spread. When this finally has a negative impact on me, there's no evidence it was unintentional, the people involved and the systems in play have to be torn down. Be smarter.

Not good enough, need an example?

The food pyramid. The misrepresentation of anything in media. Overweight diabetics losing their intelligence gaining a dependency on media validation. The drug market somehow flagrantly flying by the seat of their pants along the border of the most gun-liberal state of the USA. Texas school shootings taking a life of their own to dwarf the media coverage of gun violence, and blaming feminism, video games, bullying, definitely not the food pyramid, media, drugs, or guns.

Maybe we can't have peace until everyone has a bullet aimed at their head. Finish making robots and we'll see what happens after that.

Cars also suck, but it makes sense to blame drivers. The fact we normalized two ton giants flying past our heads, to the point people are afraid to go for a walk, or hey maybe this is why kids don't go outside, it's stupid, it's sheer stupid.

Kids, remember, overeat and go outside, if you don't sleep at night you'll be drugged and when your body burns and you think you're dying you can be put down like a dog.

Adults, remember, you're the problem not the solution. Until proven otherwise, you're the ones in charge, so if your pretense that there's nothing wrong fails you only have yourselves to blame. A hole-puncher is coming to invalidate your ticket, so get out of the parking lot before they send a TOW.
