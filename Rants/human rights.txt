Let's cut through some bullshit

human rights vs children

without the ability to reproduce, children aren't meeting the definition of life

if children could reproduce instantly, there would be no differentiation between adults and children, they would all be fully formed like ants

they could have their gender assigned like ants

this is not the case

One form of life does not imitate all other forms of life
