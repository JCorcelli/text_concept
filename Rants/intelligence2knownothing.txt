Having the strength and courage to do something, and the wisdom not to do it. Understanding a different point of view, and having self-control not to act on intuition. Having strength and skill is meaningless. A display without application is meaningless without sex. Without wisdom, someone can seek context, proof, displays of strength, skill, and disregard all meaning.

Not knowing why and displaying strength is what?

Darwin evolution without wisdom favors all these things, doesn't it. Darwin evolution without intelligence is what? Vegetable, microbial, chemical.

Stupid or smart. It's a learned behavior. A microbe can't be either, can it?

The dark horse is instinct. When someone admits doing something makes them feel good, it's not because it's inherently good, it's because evolution and some random factors that were already overcome say it feels good. We don't have culture because of random factors alone. Random factors refers to mutations that had no benefit during evolution mostly, but this is why we, sometimes someone can feel good doing things that have no societal benefit.

Someone already said, "feelings don't matter." Self-preservation has societal benefit, but instinct may summate to self-destruction, which is when people start shooting heroin and throwing things and making money for the sake of making money instead of a purpose.

Besides myself, I am not sure how many people I've met who decided they had a purpose, probably zero in person.

If you tell someone their purpose is to feel good, they can just rely on instinct and stop thinking, if they would give up their own agency so easily.
