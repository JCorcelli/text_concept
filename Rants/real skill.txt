Only in real life, can one person have so much ability or skill that it surpasses what anyone else would imagine. And yet there's still a limit, just because someone saves millions of lives once doesn't mean he'll be able to again.

In a video game, the skills that are hard-coded can't possibly reach these heights. One player vs six, quirky connection delays, equal character skills. It doesn't matter if you can force 1 on 1 with all of them, if they kill you immediately after you kill one of them you lose any advantage, you will lose even if you have a guarantee of winning all fair duels, or even if the duels were to your advantage because of quirky connection delays.


The thing is... you can always get better. There is no lesson to learn. Quitting is only correct if you are absolutely going to lose something important. Dying or losing in a video game is equivalent to having to go to sleep at night. You have to. Arguments that a video game should be playable start to finish without prior knowledge are laughable. You'd have to play a different game with the exact same solutions, and then demand a game be produced with no alteration, no challenge. At least no challenge to the person everyone expects to ace the game in one try.

Super Mario Odyssey could be beaten in about 56 minutes one day. When it came out people thought it'd be beaten in under an hour. Expecting anybody to beat a game [never seen before] in one try without randomization either means there's no challenge or they somehow expect Super Mario Odyssey to be beaten in 60 minutes or less by someone who's accomplished that feat once, every time. Of course I'm comparing randomization to intensely practiced muscle memory, but I think that's an accurate comparison.
