There are some people who are considered 'gifted'. One common sign is their skin is sensitive early on. If water temperature is not at body temperature it's unbearable.

The fact is I was already 'gifted' as a child. My nerves are starting to recover on this diet. I already consider my hands sexual objects. Now I'm abstaining. After just two days, I feel like I might go off at the slightest needle prick.

The average person argues with silence there's no sexual oppression. The news blares about sex negative practices. People mate like wild animals relying on hierarchy because the dating tradition is out of fashion. And big drawn out explanations about psychological abuse in a relationship are religiously administered while the target audience is being psychologically abused by targeted advertisements.

After briefly exercising for the past month, my body's become sensitive on my high potassium diet enrichment plan. On the contrary, I believe the opposite is true on a low potassium diet deficit plan. It would make sense, to desensitize people mentally and physically, for physical labor. This brings into question whether people are gifted or it's all a spectrum of diet efficiency. In my case, it most certainly is a sliding scale of potassium in my diet at this point.
