There are some things that we used to accept were just a part of every day life.  What we want is often accompanied by learning to fear the opposite:

want
strength, fairness, equality, success, gain, virtue, birth

fear
weakness, unfairness, inequality, failure, loss, derangement, death

Humans are the best at memorizing patterns, highly complex patterns.  They determine when it's worth doing something, through a quick prediction of its outcome. Greater fear means more risk, less enjoyment.

Games are the lowest stress environment imaginable. Lower stress means less fear. Less fear means fewer learned aversions.


Rather, with age, accepting challenge becomes voluntary. Challenge are guaranteed in real life:

punishment arbitrated through personal randomization, like when someone doesn't like you. unfairness can be something as simple as another person has a bad day, and you have to accept it, it's their bad day, not yours.

permanent removal of the player from the game, death. It's guaranteed to happen if you can't follow some safety rules.

competition, envy, greed directed to and from other players, old and new; inequality.  There's nearly zero chance this will ever go away.


Why are these factors a big deal in real life? 

Participation is required for improvement.  If the player volunteers to quit, that's it. If they are unable to, or decide not to do something, it's a huge loss in experience.

Learning with games isn't a new idea, but schools are businesses and suffer from the same aptitude sinkhole as the largest businesses. Better teachers go to better schools.  Teachers who are aware they're in the poorhouse misbehave like little kids.
