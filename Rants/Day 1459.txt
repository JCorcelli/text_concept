Day 1459
Besides what I eat having a profound effect on my everything, my body's large muscles have began aching if I don't rest them in accurate gravity neutral positions occasionally.  At this point I have no idea if I'm doing cardio but I do, still confused about how little sweat is too little, I guess the heat just passes through my ears. I've ran out of plausible possibility space for this game I write for and started programming. I've actually discovered that after I draw multiple scenes in certain paint programs over the course of two days, it's incredibly annoying to export them, but the free software is alright. But then, I could bring a list of files into a component's object array, skipping the confusion of attempting to iterate through a list in resource.load, and that was nice.
