The game quality doesn't tend to matter, it's a very light filler between rewards.

StudioFOW caters to a man's sort of romance. I especially like when the women lose their strength in the middle of intercourse because they either cum or their muscles involuntarily relax.

Besides the orgasms and muscle relaxation, I don't see this stuff in StudioFOW's work. Before I try to go onto other topics, I'll describe sex, and more importantly fictional sex that pushes the bounds of our imagination of what the body is capable of.

I'm obviously not going into every gritty detail. The possible variety of fiction, and implausibility, is what makes it enjoyable.

This is what I usually think about. I'll try to order them based on importance.

I make a big distinction between what is physically possible in real life, and what fiction is capable of. The women in fiction have day long orgasms while they're inflated by invaders from tentacle dimensions, for example. Although day long orgasms would be nice, a lot of what happens in fiction simply does not happen in a realistic model. Being inflated would most definitely hurt and cause lasting physical damage, even if someone's mentally protected. Some people who have a preference don't care about animated fiction, or fictional characters, and stick to real life actors and models.

StudioFOW as my main example is clearly fiction, despite its attempt to use realistic body shapes. Fictional women elicit a similar emotional response in me, but if anyone becomes a white knight to protect fictional women, make no mistake it's still a sexual response. Unless the writer or some complicated program changes the behavior of the women after intercourse, they will not be affected. Real life actors are still playing out fiction, but they have limitations and needs that must be taken care of, they display certain feats that fewer people would dare attempt. In both cases the emotion that's displayed is also a fiction, acting.

Although most of what I write about now makes it more and more evident that the pleasure of the sexual act and arousal increases in a woman, the mental state someone has before intercourse easily influences whether she'll be receptive and enjoy it.

A woman's face. It's obvious beauty is subjective, but I'd like to have an idea what she looks like. Face expressions like joy or disgust can easily cause emotional mirroring, so arousal or pleasure is what it is.

I put a lot more effort into trying to imagine how a woman who is receptive and fertile would behave. But there's also other potentials like displaying posture, to stick out their chest and tightening their waistline. Sticking out other body parts, or touching themself to draw attention to the body part in view of their love interest is a good sign.

Having muscles tense and relax involuntarily are clear signs of fertility. So accidentally letting out sounds, and breathing in sharply, etc., can be a good sign. A wide variety of things can happen, this is emergence where you can't predict behaviors that haven't been programmed.

Any intense enough stimulation can cause someone to stop moving when arousal comes closer to its climax this repeats. That's a sign that someone is mentally receptive and enjoying it. Also my core mental process tends to like to shut down, which really all this does is make masturbating more difficult for me. It will make copulating a very difficult to control process without one experienced partner.

It's become a bit of a kink I usually picture a girl with a bunny tail. The bunny tail could be a sticky, is optional, I'm just saying. I also prefer seeing a female's anus and vagina closer together. I like the idea that puts in my head, and regardless of which entrance is used they'll both be stimulated by pressure.

Breasts and hair are almost equal symbols of femininity in my culture. A woman with no breasts, and no hair has some novel charm, but they could easily pass as a tomboy. There's sort of an art to it, I can't really describe hair or individual body parts properly. Perky breasts are always in no matter how large they are, once a breast is at least B-cup size I personally like areolas that look big enough to fill my mouth, protrude slightly above the breast have visible bumps where the milk exits, and nipples that look like a combination of a lifesaver candy and gumdrop. If breasts are about size D and they start to defy gravity they won't be very realistic, but does it matter?

Narrow shoulders, and wider hips, within reason make an objective shift towards femininity.

There's moaning, at any point, which in some circumstances if it's done right causes my muscles to relax. Something like a higher pitched tone is fertility. Other times it sounds more like the woman is faking a long orgasm, exciting, but not quite the same. I do like a good female orgasm though, even if she's not having intercourse it will signal my attraction for a woman with intense libido.

Self-lubrication on the vulva. It's a pretty clear sign of female arousal, and it can be messy. I take interest when a woman appears to get this stuff all over the shaft of a guy who's penetrating her. Ok, there's also drooling, and tongue protrusion, nipples hardening, sweating, and thrusting their hips and sticking out their butt to present herself.

Other things like crying will increase estrogen levels. The mental aspect of sex can be almost as exciting as the first few things I wrote down, but it takes a long time to build up an emotional bond. The converse is actually rather simple, sex for the sake of relieving tension, or to create a bond that isn't there, or to cause a complex mental state.

So other than other very enjoyable kinks, that's about it.

I'm not sure how many real women would like to have their emotions and physical responses examined to thoroughly. But if there was some way to ensure their health, mental state, and arousal are all favorable before and after intercourse, that wouldn't be so bad.

Fictional women don't care, and it may be more important to alter her character subtly to reflect what the power of intercourse really has. Regardless of how positive all the parameters are, it alters the way someone thinks. When the parameters are not adequate there's damage, fictional damage that can be erased as easily as it can be applied without the cause ever being explained.

Obviously if you want to know what grown up women think about this, you'll have to ask them, I couldn't get my one girlfriend to talk in such great detail. She mostly seemed to have an amnesiac response to arousal and sleep which concerned me quite a bit. Like whether I do something right or wrong it's not going to matter. Not the kind of reinforcement I crave either. But I guess this illustrates how some people simply don't do any mental gymnastics, and would prefer to have a wolf bonding experience with a mate, and ignore any other complicated factes of sex.

So I really like to think the woman enjoys sex. I also kind of like the idea of my body doing some of these things, but stuff like leg twitching and premature ejaculation are very rare, to the point I'm actually happy when it happens because it's so unusual for there to be any change in how my arousal progresses.

Sex, basically a dangerous game in itself, but one that's highly enjoyable for many people. Very difficult to emulate properly as an art form, still very enjoyable to watch and listen to.

Finally there are things I don't enjoy looking at or hearing about. But I keep an open mind when it comes to fiction. I forgot what the phrase for that is.

It's suspension of disbelief. Right. All fantasy requires suspension of disbelief. It's dangerous if someone believes in fiction, a good fiction has a smattering of truth anyways or there's nothing to anchor our interests to.

Here's my impression of a woman's romance. When my girlfriend masturbated I'd ask what she was thinking about while she masturbates.

Her response is always "I don't know". So the best I can understand is she's somehow using her emotional state, and being in a relationship, as the fuel for arousal.

She was also the type of woman who's watching romance novels, and strongly influenced by musical lyrics, and she's the first person I ever met that tried to enjoy memes and things I couldn't do.

When we got into the topic of other men, she outright said she had no desire to have sex with men she wasn't both in love with, and in a relationship with.

Oh a bit of an aside. I don't usually factor this into fictional characters, but I was aroused by her own unique form of genius which I'm obligated not to talk about. Let's say she is a musical prodigy, if she picked up an instrument and plays a made up tune on the spot, that would be really exciting and just showing her that I can't do it, to prove to her she's so talented, is arousing. I guess I kind of put myself into a submissive posture that way, like if a muscular girl could wrestle me down in bed, I'd have to tell her she's way too strong. But I'm ok with that.

I obviously have a hard time understanding how the human body works, but we can have a greater appreciation for its complexity and its hidden potential. It's even difficult at some point during arousal to think, so it's a challenge to me.


fixed that awkward phrasing I meant "thinking while aroused is a challenge".

I dreamed of a game. First, getting consent from all the women in something like a mixed dorm.

If I unintentionally wake up too early while sleeping alone I'd sneak into the room next door where the group of them sleep, and eat one out at random until I'm relaxed or tired enough to sleep again. I'd just fall asleep there with my face and tongue buried in her ass like that.

It came to me in a dream, like an idea comes to you in real life.


edit: Erased anything too probing.

I have a lot of great ideas, but I don't want to use up all my energy thinking about it, there are other pressing matters. For now, this might be pushed to the back of my mind.

I'm feeling that thirst I keep mentioning, I wonder if I poke my head out of the cave right now, will there be a horny bunny somewhere waiting for me? Maybe, I'll try it in ten minutes. I still can't jump to conclusions.

I'll keep doing the same thing every night until this feeling subsides, but I only intend to stand outside the back of the building for a few minutes.

I'm pretty sure there will be at least one woman waiting there at midnight so I can satiate this thirst.

Alright. Now that I'm rested I can shore up the loose ends of this fantasy.

The first day there should be three women, I want to practice talking with each of them to increase my verbal social skills. I'll also find out the important details.

All the women need to be willing to receive head, but one girl should be bi because I have this idea of penetrating her while we're both licking another.

If a woman isn't on a safe day, she must bring three large condoms because from my experience half of all condoms don't work right.

They need to have plenty to eat in advance. They need to clean and lubricate their anus. They should lubricate their vaginas if they're not certain they'll get aroused enough from this. It's not only for penetration, but for flavor.

There shouldn't be more than six women on any night, because there's not a lot of space to do this out of sight.

They need to wear something fun, and if it leaves their skin exposed, they should wear any type of loose clothing to cover it up. It should be up to their personal taste since I'm going to associate it with their personality. At least, if they chose it, if I deliberately choose something for a future date that's against their personality, it's a kink.

They need to bring their own sleeping bags, mosquito repellent, water, and a sports drink because I don't have any of those things at home.

I don't want to get sick or spread disease, so the individual person must be honest, and not show up if they think there's a serious risk they might have a transmissible disease. I won't hold it against them.

These details aren't really something I'd have to worry about in a video game, so this is the best I can do to make it all real and enjoyable sounding. I look forward to talking with them, so I have a more diverse idea of how girls behave in this type of situation too.

Oh and even if I seem like I'm in charge, anything I say to them should not be taken factually or like a command, because I am going to be exploring every facet of sexuality I can, not to be confused with simple inputs and outputs of useful data.

Alright time to level with the 'audience' a bit, I only started thinking of this because I've been awake masturbating at night for far too long. I think if I saw anyone suddenly start doing that, and only getting a few hours of sleep, I'd be concerned.

And when I added lesbians to the fantasy the idea was to try and allow more non-threatening participants, but then I have to fight the desire I have while being aroused, and it's actually difficult sounding. So, maybe it'd only be safe for bisexual women until I have driven the idea home that I'd do more harm than good with my penis in some situations.

If a woman presented herself to be fertilized and used like my initial impression. My brain essentially would stop working normally.

In the ideal version of society, a man that is beguiled in such a way has nothing to lose but what he gladly gives up then and there.

Vice versa, a woman who is impregnated after being beguiled used to have a large risk.  Who's the father? Will she survive childbirth? I'm sure there's more.

Capitalism can't ever pay back what evolution takes from us.

Maybe this is the wrong topic to post this in, I'll think about it. I think it's a good fit.

I just need to hear the point of view of of someone who'd objectify and worship a penis like it's a chalice filled with mana from god, for a better understanding of the other side of the equation. I might be able to extrapolate more from that.
