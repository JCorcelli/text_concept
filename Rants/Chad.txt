But what I can do is draw a person who's literally 80% of a demographic, because that's what inbreeding gets you. When you're an 80% demographic of your race, you aren't allowed to be an asshole. Your race is a stereotype.

If you like memes so much you should see what Chad is in my reality. There's the basketball player, but there's also someone I spend a month with who repeatedly ragequit and said the stereotypical "I'm not like you." While I was still pissed at my fat older brother saying the npcs were fucking fat fucks. And if someone did a Leeroy Jenkins I told them I'd beat their ass. Not being networked, there's no such thing as physical violence. But deliberately trying to target players with insults, and players who put some effort to help you, regardless of how much their dick is flying off. Pretending to care and quitting Guild Wars for ten years is a mercy so Chad can suck my dick. He's not human, he's not like you, he's probably fat although he never eats he's got body dysmorphia. He tries to talk to you when you're reading. And he calls you stupid because you can't play basketball. And there's another thing but I think it'd literally kill all Chads.
