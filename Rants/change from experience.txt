I'm going to have to disagree with the notion that you should experience something. Not to claim that an experience is meaningless.

You can talk about intercourse and sexual relations, and hype it up. I did experience that hype around my teens. I saw it on TV, not all that in-your-face but simple things can excite a younger person easily. You can learn so much you reach the point where you understand it better than someone who has had long-lasting functional relations, children, and even people counseling others on the topic.

It is possible that experiencing something takes away from the enjoyment of it because of the change it causes. And it can very well affect two people in completely opposite ways.

I don't believe in hyping up things in general. If someone wants an experience, and that experience is hype, what's the difference between denying them freedom of speech and denying there's a purpose in enjoying life?

The final perspective is, when someone can't experience something. The choice to try, and lack a faculty to experience does not change how someone functions. Experiencing something changes how someone functions when they really want to keep doing it. This isn't the definition of addiction, it is learning.
