So...
I think I'll watch Minecraft more

I'm overpowered

ok whales are overpowered

The reason I'm overpowered is I paid bare minimum attention in class and tried to be creative at a young age without doing much

At some point I thought I might need to work on my physical skills, drawing, 3D, but it turns out my brain just needed to return to normal, during that period I philosophised even if I couldn't reach any valid conclusions

the way a whale gets overpowered is by spending money in a pay to win game

there is a hypothetical game where we'd both get what we want, and people who don't understand philosophy could learn if that's what the game's about

Ok I'll think about being a whale figuratively

I spend money either to help someone or enjoy my user experience as well as maintain my standard of living. That's the basics.

I have the impression Notch was tortured with drugs but for some reason he wasn't able to recover. So if he was so insecure I should spend money to make sure he has more than anyone else. Who is he to me?

Someone I've been spending money on sells his company instead of sticking with the product. I'd be fucking pissed off at him, I'd tell him to get his ass back to work.

If he admits he was drugged and tortured I might change my mind. You don't get pity just for being fat you fuck don't be a piece of crap with that money I spent I'll do something if I ever think of what would fit this pathetic display of sheepish withdrawal into shitposting your video game of the week.

There that's a whale you just betrayed, assuming you were anything besides an advertiser.

Ok. I'll imagine I as a millionaire who only spent about 5000, well, I don't care right? That's so little.

In this unique case of Diablo Immortal your algorithm has screwed my user experience.
