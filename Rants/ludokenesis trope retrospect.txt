Psychology
The first time is an imprint (psych. token memory). It's meaningless, but impressive enough there's an allocation of resources in our mind to fill that gap.

The second time, we all recognize it, a bold clue in plain view (movies).

Something that doesn't exist has no meaning, and neither does it the first time, an ontology.


In computer terms, token memory is a vulnerability while it hasn't been patched.


reality trope
People talk about 'rules' to a discipline, when there isn't a rule. Structure is required, and arbitrary rules are just patterns drawn from it.

game trope
There's some learning curve that people must get past to fully enjoy many games

moon logic, which happens in games all too often, where incontinuity in puzzles makes a game impossible. If it's never been introduced, you know most players will have a hard time, and possibly never understand that it shouldn't be solved the way they're used to doing it. Real world example: politics had power, and people who wanted to make changes would rely on it. Now they all want to feel safe and remain wealthy. Politics no longer has the same sway, but people who were reaised to believe it does won't change their course.
