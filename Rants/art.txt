When I think of art I think of elegance, a potential to open someone's mind. When someone thinks of art as antagonism, it must be something blunt and closed minded.

One version of expression gains fans.  The other expression is about attacking everything.

I'll put it this way. Art is able to be acted upon, not controlled. Anything can act upon art.

Real art is worth preserving.

The human body is art, anyone can act on your body. An artist is preferable to a fucked up loser in a white coat. An artist actually gives a shit about improving art.
