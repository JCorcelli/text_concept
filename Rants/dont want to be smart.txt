Here's why you don't want to be 'smart'

You won't worship authority figures. Because:
You can picture yourself in their position. You'd do something different, you'd do something similar, you're a function not royalty to be worshipped.

Motives become almost useless. There must be a greater picture, and you must know what that is.

You learn and discover what governs reality in order to find what can be reached for now.

When you don't understand an outcome, in an irreplicable scenario, you will simply admit you don't know how it happened and move on. Justifications to build up a case favoring your impeccable functionality becomes a total waste of time, when you realize you'd be insulting everyone else doing so.

You will understand words like ineqality are neutral. Creating an incredibly long list of meanings for words is not a functional behavior. We may have emotional context, when emotion is desired. If someone says 'scrub' in a video game, it's an insult. If someone says 'scrub' while cleaning, it's an action.

You don't want any of that because being smart is too easy. As soon as you start forcing people to think like you, your life becomes hard, because you're stupid.
