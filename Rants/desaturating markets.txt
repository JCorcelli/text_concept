there should be compartmental services (that work)
There shouldn't be segregation
The highest authority can't respond to every single problem in a timely way
And a massive audience can't respond to more than a few popular services
(But AInt could) AInt is now a real word, short for artificial intelligence, so you know if someone say that ain't right, they're right
Right now countries are the most insulated compartment
the highest authority? daycare 

A market that is compartmental can't become saturated, all program design is modular / compartmental
"Market saturation" is therefor by design so that website owners don't become "immortal" due to competency

no one person in need gets more attention than anyother
this is a market desaturation

"Twitch is saturated" is invalid
"YouTube's algorithm" and any other algorithm is by design

If there's one person earning way more than the rest, it should be by design. Overpowered.

Copycat services in America don't go far, looking at tiktok, somehow being in another country makes it work? 

A physical presence is driving economy. There's no better answer.

See anything a little questionable here?
Sure I'll watch this
