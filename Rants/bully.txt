bully

define bully
it simply says "a person who habitually seeks to harm or intimidate those whom they perceive as vulnerable." with origins nobody cares about meaning "a lover" or "a friend"

In practice, bully is in a school related cotext. Someone who corrects the mistakes of children, ie a nun slapping with a ruler. Having been instructed properly themselves, ie another child or upperclassman.

Revision
Bully, verb. to correct a child in school. ie an instructor, educator, wealthy caste, or upperclassman with proper education.

Outside of school, to be a parent to a child is to bully.


Here is how "bully" is misused in today's lexicon

it combines definitions of many words 

extortion, to harm or intimidate

sadism, to perceive a vulnerable person as a target

rape, to harm or intimidate with sexual intent

child, someone without experience

snob, someone of a higher class looking down on others

sadism + extortion or rape, to harm or intimidate those whom they perceive as vulnerable

The attempt to turn a strong positive into a negative is strong in English speaking society so here's how bully has evolved from lover of a higher education to a rapist child.

the opposite of "lover" is "rapist" therefor bully meaning lover now means rapist

the opposite of "upperclass elitist" is "oblivious"

the opposite of "instruct" is "intimidate"

With proper use in today's society a bully might correct me in saying this, because they are an elitist snob that's been well trained in word fuckery.

So the next time someone is trying to morph a positive word into a negative, you should bully them. Because now you know better than they do.
