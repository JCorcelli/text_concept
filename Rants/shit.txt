I'll take @anonymous Western-centric media critique and unfortunately I have an answer. 


What would you do if you had 3 months to live? Don't answer this out loud. I'd probably have a crap ton of sex and worry less about eating until I'm hungry, at least that's my gut response. (I masturbate for a year)

Ok, what would you do if you had 90 more years to live (give or take 85)? I'm going to make a depressing revelation now and then. I'll practice stuff people find boring to the last nucleus. I'll say stuff that scares off the opposite sex and makes me sound ridiculous. What I do, basically. (accurate)

What's the difference between the two?

Version 1 is akin to a premeditated suicide, an end of the world prophecy. In 3 months the worst STI someone can contract won't be fully blown.  In such a short time Karma can't be used as a social medium. In 3 months you have enough time to form a stupid plan, a week is probably long neough, and just enough time to practice. In 3 months you will suffer intense pain from eating non-stop, but you can probably dull it with drugs, and if you have 3 months to take insulin, that's a pretty long time to go see a doctor. (or someone could drug you retarded for 3 months and your life goes to hell and stays there for 2 years, what do you do then? You just, have hell, you can't leave it. It has nothing to do with what you're doing.)

Version 2. It's bullshit. It's not happening.

People don't choose version 1, it's forced on them. Or quite possibly, something went wrong because they weren't warned. 

Yeah, now these motherfuckers choosing version 1 for people are going to have to taste their own medicine right? Eat it motherfuckers.
