Mars/Scorpio / Cerberus
 I'm a bunny...
scorbunny = scorpion + bunny
looks like torchick... but isn't
astrological features, they're saying, or even agreeing I'm not a scorpio
a fire tiger of the Chinese zodiac, comes very close to cat/bunny, 

koreans are cats based on the zodiac. 
Chinese zodiac as is, bunny.

Scorpio has stinger
Ophiucan has serpent
Same issue as always but the symbolism changes

So does a fire-tiger sound more dangerous than a fire-bunny? Ye yeah probably.
