everything that already works perfectly will continue to work
and as long as something new works perfectly it will work the same way

everything new that we want to work can work perfectly in due time

things people put a lot of hard work into that others want to see have incredible value so if they can talk about it and offer nothing but money for support then I guess that they should try using that

something that already works is not art, art is the pursuit of perfection and can never be the end result, although it might be called Art as a product
