Problems
	Mesh looks like crap close up. 
	Big voxels look like crap close up. 
	Small voxels render too slow. 
	
Solution. Small voxels can be in a confined area, close up. Vector-Mesh can be everywhere else.

mesh in vectors is cheap to render
voxel is detail

voxels up to a distance for greater detail and atomic scaled realism

mesh farther away generated from the voxel data
