Summary: this is a game about leading a follower back home.

mouse game mechanic:
if you guide someone under their willpower they can be attracted to other objects

additional nuance:
You (the mouse) are a lightsource, with predictive ability, you can see things that a person following can't.

NPC generalization:
All characters follow the same rules.
All NPC, not just the MC are attracted to your mouse
They will follow until distracted or caught off guard.
