My calculator (4 years). It fakes Bayesian networks, information theory, and NLP with parameters acting as contexts such as story, objects in scene; with medium-related physics and other analog filters like character experience. Lambda methods embedded in text being parsed are triggered based on context. Etc.

My parser (4 months), one of the three, generates GUI based on preprogrammed rules. Inserting interactive elements from a grid-oriented abstract language that can read in four directions or along a chain of connected chars. For scale, it also changes rules with a parameter.

Code and comments can be embedded inline with both custom languages.

An autoclicker. It plays an offline game. It executes strategies that require constant focus, hours of grinding, and lightning reflexes.
