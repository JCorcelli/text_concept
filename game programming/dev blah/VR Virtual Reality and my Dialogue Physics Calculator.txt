I still believe Virtual Reality can be achieved

# end-user pitch

it succeeds at imitating a camera, human memory, writing on paper, etc.

it succeeds at imitating watching a video, trying to remember, and reading from paper (respectively).

characters will do and imitate what a player expects them to, from script, to play a role in their fantasy


# The technical details are many


The program I wrote can significantly improve a flexibility of written 
* dialogue
* polling character action

it can poll, procedurally generate descriptions of
* events
* actions
* objects
	


The calculator is the main loop
* For everyday writing, a custom markup language allows for code to execute from scripted dialogue like an event system (it does not interfere, and on debug programmers are notified to implement the missing methods)
* For everyday modding, there's a front-end layer that allows new calculator functions to be modded (this has not been tested)

* it's a contextual and dialogue-based system, non-linear, as the on-screen dialogue has been implemented to be recoded in the future as a notepad, or a grid-based format, allowing runtime coding.
* The dialogue is ready for anything to modify it realtime via code
* The base classes have been set up to allow inheritance, still a bare-bones concept

In order to make everything work I included a custom text class- with gui, main-loop calculator, markup language for writing dialogue, and an incomplete "Yes" man (omni-direcitonal lang) for scripting entirely new Gui

# A small giant, “Yes” man


I've been developing “Yes” man as an arbitrary omni-directional esolang to code GUI from scratch. Not limited to OS and file system emulation, which will be child's play, it is meant for modding and seamlessly gamifying new scripted code. It will branch into 3D space before it's even done. Once it is done, it should be easily adapted into a real time graphic generator, a development interface.


Much of the physics-based work uses the same GUI code now, so any of the old redundant physics are not worth updating

# ChaosGame Relevance

microverse/macroverse has been produced in "Yes" Man a language that easily describes 2d grids of gui and can reproduce a window-like environment

tech: the concepts, and existence of things are in libraries for down/up-load, preset, or learned. Respectively computers, NPC, and realtime learning (simulated by NPC among player-facing interfaces).

Containers: Reflects generic hierarchy.

Contains tech. Though containers may be outside of context and visuals, and therefor subsumed into text physics.

Location: Buildings, spawned objects, and objects are significant entities in the info layer of dialogue.

Inventory: This can be handled by combining containers and restricting removal, or replacement.

# PfoteGame Relevance

The program systems coalesce into several categories

Dialogue Physics
	Prewritten dialogue with scripting
	Prewritten events
	Finite states of the surrounding scene
	Info storage quality and simulation
		Mutating information
		Failure to remember concise or specific information
	
Player-facing Interaction
	NPC Dialogue
	Character Development
	Tutorial
	Education
	catalogs of items
	
Programming variables and virtual environment hooks that allow the game's environment to respond
	Parsing scripts within dialogue
	Scripting actions to occur as dialogue does
	Generating dialogue ahead of time for predictions, before parsing
