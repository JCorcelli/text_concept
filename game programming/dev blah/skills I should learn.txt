I've dropped the attempt to stimulate dopamine. 

What I am currently interested in is getting each faculty related to game development developed. 

no specific order: -cliffnote

draw/sculpt with interface - details I don't have to write

music/sound - dabble

brain games (working memory)- play well, not intensely

typing, writing minutia - I've gone over by myself writing about 
	characters, 
	world building, 
	game mechanics, 
	game world summary, 
	dimorphic ludo-narrative systems, 
	experience systems (educational, point based, player, skill, and narrative intersection). S
	ometimes I write a story that doesn't translate to a grand design in my spare time, to experiment with what sounds good.

program - Compartmentalize this syntax. This is separate from writing.

write using my 'scripted' markup - my main mechanic that isn't entirely programmed yet 
	the written dialogue is so much importance to the success

meditation - I think I am doing this right

vocabulary - de, en?

Also, what will people remember? And will this matter to them later?
mnemonics?
	or how to make things memorable
