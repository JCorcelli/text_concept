Astronomical Physics Emulation

I think this is more the department Rocket science would be concerned about, in the future, but it's worth the effort to think about.

We need to understand how much mass alters space-time or astronomical calculations remain far from accurate. In fact, the difference in time between two planets may be so large. Mars for example, could have a time gap of several minutes, or days in the future, compared to Earth per year.

Some pseudo-science monologue
The rudimentary explanation is, the universe behaves like it's filled with a fluid and currents. In outer space, physics disobeys how we expect a completely empty vacuum to behave, in very strange ways.


These aren't mutually exclusive theories, and seem to work with much about what is already known. So, they can only be disproved later.

Evidence of time dilation
The evidence is, we know that time is slower the higher gravity is. Inanimate objects leaving the solar system appear to accelerate.

Space-time that is outside gravity is relatively 'fast' compared to our time which remains nearly the same, and to our idle observation it looks like a shift in speed and direction.

My Conclusions due to this phenomenon
Time obeys gravity, mass in its natural state is a higher priority of the natural law, preceding time in dimensions.

Theory of individual time
Time obeys mass, not the other way around. Matter equals mass, mass increases gravity, gravity increases time.


Extrapolation

Dark matter, it's determined to exist because of extra mass that doesn't absorb or emit radiation.

The current theory about dark matter
We can't see dark matter, we're not advanced enough to see it.


An old theory I had
This is slightly poetic, it can't be disproven, but there's no real evidence either. I'll float it by anyways.

Dark matter could be mass existing in other dimensions, but gravity only exists in the 3rd dimension, so we don't see 4th dimensional collisions with our 3rd dimension.


New Theories
Disprove the premise and the rest falls apart. The individual theories can be disproven as well some day, if they're worth the effort, and wrong.

Premise
Dark matter is mass-time we can't observe directly at this point and time.

Scientists can easily observe an object's mass, but its mass-time is different, the every point in time mass exists has gravity. The difference in time causes a falloff in gravity so any observable mass has finite gravity.

So if 85% of the mass in the universe is dark matter it is the past and future of individual bodies of mass.


Mass-Time-Bucking Dilemma

When calculating the discrepancy of high speed acceleration upon massive objects, an object that accelerates very quickly will require additional force, its own past drags it backwards. Compared to the total gravity of a planet next to a rocket, it may be easy to ignore. An object with mass can't reach reach light speed without being converted into energy.

I also heard from one sonic episode of Game Theory that your mass would become anti-matter of equal mass if you went back in time so, at some point it's pure energy.


Some pseudo-science, Anti-matter Precognition
You would absolutely end up with brain damage when anti-matter destroys parts of your brain, but a message in a bottle could travel back to cause severe stress, from that perception of danger you'd change the future.

Some pseudo-science, Tachyon Precognition
If you could send tachyons back, it would be very similar to accelerated thought, if you remained still for a long period of time and practice positive thinking, you'd get something like a precognitive mood boost.
