This is just where my mind decided to go this morning. It's pretty common I have a strange stream of ideas every morning, but they're not usually so real sounding.

There's a far-flung future problem with deep space.

Traveling near light-speed isn't the only thing messing with our perception of time. From a solar-bound perspective, something like a generational ship that's on a 10,000 year journey enters deep space at a conservative pace and pops out of the other end, nearly instantly because the space-time is so thin their relative time is down to a millionth. This is simply a phenomenon we aren't equipped to observe, bodies that travel through deep space are a closed system of massive gravity and light.

Without the correct variables, deep-space navigation is going to be a series of estimates and corrections. What if we severely undershoot our destination? What if our absolute speed is so far off, a closed system appears to accelerate past us, and continues to do so when we chase after it?
During a deep space journey the rest of the universe would appear to stop moving. This would prompt a space ship to correct its course and point at where it wants to be based on the intuitive model of velocity. When the universe begins moving again, and a small body enters a closed system, they'd begin observing the real speed the closed system is moving at, it would appear to accelerate.
With correct variables and estimates, reaching the right destination at the correct absolute speed is finally possible.

Ok. On the grand scheme of things. We may find a way to live in deep space, separate from matter, so it might not even matter by then.

Those are the obvious problems. Now more about the change in perception based on individual time.

Individual time alters my perception of how The Big Bang would have occurred
It's quite possible the universe was a solid clump of subatomic particles end to end before time existed, because there was no time to prompt movement. The sudden crunch to a point in space would have been instantaneous, the universe was both a solid mass of particles and a single point of mass in the instant it was created.

All the time in the universe is condensed at that moment. There is no point in space-time, or physical form of matter, that will ever have existed longer. The lifetime of the matter in the universe from a multiverse perspective, is dramatically shorter as its gravity spreads thin.

Another way to look at it is, material death is definitely going to restart this chain of events. If particles are the only thing remaining, there will be no time once again. But, rather than a complete reset, there will very likely be subatomic crunching on a smaller scale, black holes may even form from what we perceive as nothing, assuming we're still there to observe it.

Because of mass-time, I think time behaves more like a physical substance
We only have gravity as a detection method. But this is where extra dimensional beings come into play. Time itself could be a valuable resource an extra-dimensional species can harvest. So, most likely the target would be a sup9er-dense object that's not quite a black hole, because black holes have strange properties.

I may start saying time is 'thin' in deep space or it 'increases' when the multiverse lifespan for things near other massive objects is much greater. I don't think it'll be too hard to understand.

Metal Gear Solid was a heavy influence on some of the things I thought about as a teenager. I mean, the whole joke about genetics, fatalism.  I was already determining environment factors, and there's no way we understood the genome yet, so the game's predictions were a joke. Genes make some people taller, they would be better soldiers in medieval warfare, I know that now jk jk. I thought about the nonsense a lot of people said during high school, mostly the actual people around me, sometimes the books I read, sometimes the video games, they were all pretty skewed to an ideal I didn't need to understand, it was simply too flawed. I know the term dangerous nonsense, and what it means too well, it came from every direction. Games can't be blamed for doing the same thing everyone else did.

I was hearing a guy in a video talk about how you go to school. And some people have to use faith to assert what they're learning will be useful. I know for a fact even short animations validating information greatly enhance people's memory. The few people who don't believe anything they learn in school is useful, because it's all so abstract, need to see someone apply it on a regular basis.

Case and point: The teachers proved they could read during elementary school. The teachers had to read everything out of a book to avoid saying the wrong thing. Most kids learned to read, even if they don't use it.

Although kids like me would be less prone to pick up a skill just because they saw someone else using it. And for a long time I thought it was funny they had to refer to books for even the smallest detail.

Enter games. Even inaccurate depictions of physics and real world events add interest. Inevitably, what matters right now is how well an individual can detect dissembling, coercion, fiction, or lies, by the time they're an adult. That is a set of skills you practice, sometimes by getting disappointed repeatedly. Then once a flimsy bit of information enters your scope, something you can understand but don't believe, the next step is discovering the truth, which is another set of skills.

Faith based learning doesn't practice these skills, but observation based learning does. On the other hand if you convince yourself everything you hear will be useful later, regardless of how abstract it currently is, it's easier to be creative. So, I deliberately thought, even if stuff sounds useless, it was useful, it's important I hear about more things, rather than crystallize the knowledge right away, so I actually can't really understand things for a couple of weeks when I first learn about them. They are quite possibly invalid data.

On an individual level, putting more effort into improving your grade is a subjective sense of improvement. So, if a kid does minimal effort for 70% of the grade, that is what they will do, because a lot of practice in school is based around challenging your information refractory period, and punishing you for not having a developed brain. It either doesn't matter, and a kid does the minimal effort, or it matters and a kid is internalizing unfairness as a way of life.

Real world example is my elementary school was too easy so I got nearly perfect scores while sleeping through class. I never really was able to remember things quickly on command, certain stimuli like things they wrote on the paper would cause the memory to surface, usually. After that, it felt like I was in a real school starting in 6th grade, and scored about 80% of the grade most classes, sleeping. But the classes got weird, they wanted us to apply everything we learned Monday on Friday, and we got weekend homework. I did my homework in school for a pretty good reason.

Enter games. I don't want to think about school at home. I don't want anyone seeing me doing homework at home. Reminding anyone I was in school seemed like a faux pas for the self-centered nihilism my family adopted at the time. A few times I ended up on the floor doing math because the homework from certain math classes are somehow two hours long just to get a check marked off.

Unironically, playing video games at home for me was practicing how to think under pressure. Quite literally, harder than an exam, learn to keep a cool head under pressure a few seconds away from danger, and you can take an exam without a single hint of anxiety.

I wasn't able to acknowledge I was a fan of anything until I was about 27 years old. My opinion of things was simply that things were, and they weren't what they looked like.

Now, objectively, a large portion of time is wasted because the environment of school is inappropriate. The teachers in high school should be bored, but they function out of their enjoyment of near-repetitive doling of useless information. They never stop to conserve their energy and react inappropriately to small pokes at the accuracy of their lesson and if asked a question they say they'll get to it later, and they usually don't.

After watching videos of the games that came after the games I played, I know I'm a fan.

It's like, when everything's too simple you expect a meta, and the only meta is socializing doesn't get taught in school, you have to steal it.

...

As for my opinion of video games. The things you might be introduced to early on have a stronger impact, whatever your chemical makeup is. In my case it would unlock a great deal of possibilities. The stuff I imagined as a kid really stuck with me. Video games have not lived up to that, but I understand the technical limitations are still in effect.

So, you know someone who just talks about a bunch of things that couldn't possibly happen to relax, that's an approximation. More accurately, I'd talk about the game, like it has no technical limitations, and the possibilities I imagined came to life on the screen. Eventually I'd get back to the game and recognize its simplicity, and I'd be able to easily beat it.

In reality games are almost entirely skill based, so they have a real value of teaching practical and quick thinking, and hand coordination (I'm ambidextrous), without lasting consequences that would discourage continuing. Games aren't really that amazing, they're only the greatest thing to happen to my brain.

This caters to my experiential bias too much. I like the idea that a realm of uncertainty in video games and mythology could grow our creative experience. School was incredibly easy until I somehow made it harder for myself.

A realm of uncertainty in our every day life, like socializing and economics, tends to push people who are obsessed with survival to the solution that comes naturally, earning money now, and trying to stay out of conflicts while remaining under an umbrella of safety.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR2P5vW-nVc&ab_channel=BigThink?

After I thought about it. It sounds too easy.

How about, creativity causes uncertainty? Because avoiding the uncertainty is to avoid the creativity.

I'm going to post an unrealistic interpretation of economics so don't get too excited.

First let me introduce my economic experience. I learned about laissez faire capitalism in school, and I understand monopolies, in capitalism, if unchecked they can drive out competitors. A very contradictory foundation to say the least, but necessary because a growing economy is organic.

So basically my older brother learned about money, early, and he was pure evil when he had the slightest hint he understood anything about the world so I ended up being treated completely different and ended up both saving it, and not respecting it in the slightest.

You know RTS games, like Command & Conquer where you gather all all the resources from the map because it makes you feel like you accomplished everything? The mission is done, there's nothing else to do, the world is over. That's what happens to business when the economy can't grow anymore. Inevitably, something needs to take complete control of global resources, but I'm not sure what.

In Sim City pollution kills the flow, and your population. That's easily compared to global warming.

These are old video games, and they were better models at predicting real world circumstances caused by poor planning and an inability to grow beyond the given mission. If there's a system we're expecting to work, make a game out of it. If there's no system we're expecting to work, well that sucks, crowdsource for ideas. Make a game if you think it'll be fun, too.

Astronomical Physics Emulation

I think this is more the department Rocket science would be concerned about, in the future, but it's worth the effort to think about.

We need to understand how much mass alters space-time or astronomical calculations remain far from accurate. In fact, the difference in time between two planets may be so large. Mars for example, could have a time gap of several minutes, or days in the future, compared to Earth per year.

Some pseudo-science monologue
The rudimentary explanation is, the universe behaves like it's filled with a fluid and currents. In outer space, physics disobeys how we expect a completely empty vacuum to behave, in very strange ways.


These aren't mutually exclusive theories, and seem to work with much about what is already known. So, they can only be disproved later.

Evidence of time dilation
The evidence is, we know that time is slower the higher gravity is. Inanimate objects leaving the solar system appear to accelerate.

Space-time that is outside gravity is relatively 'fast' compared to our time which remains nearly the same, and to our idle observation it looks like a shift in speed and direction.

My Conclusions due to this phenomenon
Time obeys gravity, mass in its natural state is a higher priority of the natural law, preceding time in dimensions.

Theory of individual time
Time obeys mass, not the other way around. Matter equals mass, mass increases gravity, gravity increases time.


Extrapolation

Dark matter, it's determined to exist because of extra mass that doesn't absorb or emit radiation.

The current theory about dark matter
We can't see dark matter, we're not advanced enough to see it.


An old theory I had
This is slightly poetic, it can't be disproven, but there's no real evidence either. I'll float it by anyways.

Dark matter could be mass existing in other dimensions, but gravity only exists in the 3rd dimension, so we don't see 4th dimensional collisions with our 3rd dimension.


New Theories
Disprove the premise and the rest falls apart. The individual theories can be disproven as well some day, if they're worth the effort, and wrong.

Premise
Dark matter is mass-time we can't observe directly at this point and time.

Scientists can easily observe an object's mass, but its mass-time is different, the every point in time mass exists has gravity. The difference in time causes a falloff in gravity so any observable mass has finite gravity.

So if 85% of the mass in the universe is dark matter it is the past and future of individual bodies of mass.


Mass-Time-Bucking Dilemma

When calculating the discrepancy of high speed acceleration upon massive objects, an object that accelerates very quickly will require additional force, its own past drags it backwards. Compared to the total gravity of a planet next to a rocket, it may be easy to ignore. An object with mass can't reach reach light speed without being converted into energy.

I also heard from one sonic episode of Game Theory that your mass would become anti-matter of equal mass if you went back in time so, at some point it's pure energy.


Some pseudo-science, Anti-matter Precognition
You would absolutely end up with brain damage when anti-matter destroys parts of your brain, but a message in a bottle could travel back to cause severe stress, from that perception of danger you'd change the future.

Some pseudo-science, Tachyon Precognition
If you could send tachyons back, it would be very similar to accelerated thought, if you remained still for a long period of time and practice positive thinking, you'd get something like a precognitive mood boost.

I remember Einstein was quoted for "spooky action at a distance" referring to quantum entanglement.

This is more like it.

Humans that make it to deep space would all be well informed, and it's of no immediate concern. Something like a colony ship might not even be possible for a billion years.

I think it's pretty cool actually. It really grounds the ideas for a really technical type of game I have been thinking about making since I was a kid. The story of said game, is non-existent. The idea has been in my head for over 30 years.

I wish my creativity came from that ambition and none of the other crap I've talked about. It's a very abstract concept, to have an idea that has no real purpose running in the back of your head as long as you have the energy to think about it. As a kid it's pretty entertaining, but you're obviously stuck in your own world because of it, and it's a pretty strange thing to try and bring it up.

I wasn't able to think about this all year. There's a high-level concept associated. Something like, the organic evolution of the planet would never, ever, end up making the things in my head, but they could still work. Things work even when they are destined to fail, and that makes it fun to imagine somehow. Yes, a party balloon is really cool, and it is destined to deflate.

We live in a metaphorical party balloon, within a larger balloon more like a zeppelin, and an ever larger water balloon.

I said I didn't know much about economics. That's still true.

There are things people absolutely need. There are controls in place preventing them from just going out and taking what they want, which is both good (property protection) and bad (land barons).

Capitalism has a value by man hours and growth. The government rationalized that growth is good, so even if it breaks a few obvious unspoken rules, growth is growth until there's a law.

Capitalism might be the only thing that allows growing economies. A model of control will cut off an economy, it will slow things down.

A person who's highly motivated by money might have the same response to a bribe that I do to a pretty girl. They'd look away awkwardly and pretend there's nothing there right? But they really want that money shoved in their face.

Capitalism's crimes are precedents for what we absolutely can't repeat. There's a book The Green Mile. Well, when I heard about the bunnies dying, all I could think was "they killed them with [they] love". Apparently it wasn't just physical affection, but mosquitos could spread it too.

This illustrates the good and bad about how powerful a capitalist system is for recruiting workers.

Bird is symbol of freedom but the channel's progress implies they never stopped working all year, the bird box has videos on record for a span of about 6 months.

It's unclear if the bottle caps are difficult to find, or if the experiment has a stockpile of them in view.

A system without banking and property is fully operational with just a little conditioning.

Humans do similar tasks, payment for sorting and moving boxes at approximately their level of tolerance. When their core strength is employed, there is significant risk involved without training. Humans of any age enjoy collecting bottle caps as a source of currency for their amusement, with no material gain, in games like Fallout, because they use their hands excessive amounts.

Humans can be trained in hands-work. As long as a human's needs are met, there's a strong desire to learn, and to use tools, and exploit the systems that govern their actions. It will have a low risk for injury. On the contrary humans exhibit obsessive compulsory self-motivation to keep working beyond physical tolerance, and need to be offered some sort of payment or a social more to stop.

There's something called piece work, where the workers use their hands for ie sorting and shelling, it pays based on the skill of their hand eye coordination. It is possibly an industry that would argue it deserves to remain, regardless of how repetitive the tasks are. Human hands are very good when trained properly. I think a repetitive task would be absolutely torture though.

Some additions.

"There are things people absolutely need. There are controls in place preventing them from just going out and taking what they want, which is both good (property protection) and bad (land barons)."

This begs the question. What do people do to get something they want if they can't just take it? And the answer capitalism provides is, a thing needs a price, otherwise you need to do something outside the scope of capitalism.

"I think a repetitive task would be absolutely torture though."

This seems to contradict the fact I'd voluntarily do certain repetitive tasks. Here's the difference. I'd do things, to improve a specific faculty, to strengthen a muscle, to increase my performance in general. I technically can't do it the same way twice, until I'm nearly perfect. I'll do things more than once if it's not too dangerous, and the result is difficult to understand. The notion I might have done a thing differently, until I can get the expected result remains. Things you can't actually improve at by repeating don't count, like eating, that produces a chemical reaction.

I couldn't find a good example of the piece work I was thinking about. But the gist is if you are paid by the hour, that's an incentive to relax, and wait for a pay raise. If you're paid by the item you finish, that's an incentive to go hyper speed so you get paid at your unique skill output. If there were a job for picking up bottle caps, a bird would beat a human any day, if human is limited to his hands.

What if the bomp bah bomp bah bomp was just a thing everyone felt with another human. We'd have common phermones among phenotypes to identify a breed ready mate and available information of a variety of mechanisms for perturbing arousal, which will be dependent on the individual's unique physical form.

The ram in the rama lama ding dong. Someone probably felt that reading the first paragraph.

The bop in the bop shoo bop shoo bop. If the changes to our brain were quickly reversible we could enjoy an entire bop day or two without physical dependency.

The dip in the dip da dip da dip. Pathetic. With some cardio and a decent diet he could have made that a bang in the bang brrr bang brrr bang.

I'm a game developer, so I'm not making light of the following.

Ai actually means machine learning algorithm in this context.

I see videos saying ai probably will do the same work as a creative. The response it's trying to elicit is, my job, oh no. Can it create an entire video game? Not yet, but maybe soon. There is detailed emulation run by ai, gritty parts of game engines that aren't working require an entire custom programmed system to shore up such loose ends.

I've read on the message boards, people ask why isn't there something that can make the entire game for them with a few inputs? These probably aren't serious game developers, who've spent years growing their skill set, but what if they did become game developers?

The solution most people look for right away is what elicits an oh no response after they've spent years of effort.

So I must ask, how can this technology be improved now?

My interpretation is, for now, if you have a new idea, an ai would have to be trained to emulate that. People are only afraid of one type of ai, the singularity that can invent things, and it will invent things like any of us can breathe, its decisions surpass human intuition so it gets lucky all the time, and it simply has the answer to everything because there's nothing we can think of that it can't simply know already, somehow.

I've been avoiding gluten for a few years now and I think my internal organs have healed. Sensation has returned to my extremities, I can control muscle, and my nervous system is beginning to heal so I can remember, and although my muscle memory died off years ago I think it's building up again.

There's this trick where you stand in a door jam and push out with your shoulders. If you walk away your arms feel like they float up. Mine don't do that, I also lifted weights with zero payoff for a long time too which could be related.

I strongly recommend that you see a doctor for whatever this is if you haven't done so already.

I saw a doctor. Happy? I feel much better now.

edit: I had some time to think about it.
Extra dimensional objects can exist in more locations than one.
Any object constrained to a dimension would dissolve or implode when entering a higher dimension unaided.

The assumption worth making is if we're not constrained and exist in every possible dimension, safe teleportation is a matter of understanding stuff.  In a sense, it's been proven time travel is possible (not cited), we just can't generate enough power [escape a black hole] unless we can go faster than light, or bend the laws as we know it.

Uhh. Uh. Ok. This is a conditional, it is possible going faster than light.

We can't, because we can't go faster than light.

And finally it isn't possible, because whatever we try to send back would inevitably turn into pure energy, and remain at the speed of light. At least until we find some special way to circumvent this issue.

Things seem like they're going alright. But I have a problem, I can't actually make the game I wanted to as a kid, alone anyways, and I won't publish anything about it until I finish everything else. I barely think about it now, even though it may very well have been a major influence on my imagination. So, I am almost certain, my creativity stems from keeping the depths of it a secret.

It would be pretty hard to explain in words since there's so many alien races, their personalities and traits weren't written down, the number of sci-fi inventions outweigh anything I've read or heard about in books, or seen on tv. I spurred them on through sheer childhood imagination, I only see tropes from time to time, really vaguely explained. As an adult I can probably write the history of it.

Anyways, my health is immaculate now. I had a great dream last night too.

Ok look at this... it looks fake. There's nothing there to convince me this is a game.  It's tinting the screen, it's showing me a voxelized version, and a granular version of a map.

I gave a small effort to find out if the ai codex is real by signing up, but without something real enough to prove to me, that these algorithms are doing what they claim to be doing, I think it's pretty bullshit.

The realistic fluid simulation stuff that I saw earlier was believable. Some of the recent stuff could have been faked, preprogrammed. This however, is a lazy pile of nothing, which somehow stands out.

When I see this, I can understand the prediction model intuitively, and they show us the data being extrapolated in real time, believable. In the first 6 minutes I see enough to believe it has a chance of working. It's very obvious this is a functioning algorithm.

I suppose if someone spent a few months, they could fake that 'stitch' example. But what a waste of time that'd be.

Ok, if anyone watched the second video it points out something in the first video. Anyways, here's some unbiased cherry picked warning for the present.

Tesla cars are real. They are not perfect.

I think I have the bad sleep genes. Although I wasn't convinced for a while.

My body's utter disregard for meltaonin and a reasonable sleep cycle despite being in good shape again seem to confirm it.

I don't believe in strange monsters or video game logic mixing into reality at the present time and I won't fight any medical intervention. But the ARG has been strong for the past 15 days, so it's not like my decisions were always going to be correct.

I think all their ideas are quite familiar. Youtube is reminding me I'm not really in the loop of who is who, or who knows what.

Sadhguru pins down the notion that without more accurate understanding of consciousness, it could jeopardize our potential if we go straight into becoming cyborgs and altering all of humanity's DNA. In another video he explains if we can stop worry about survival, we'll stop identifying with things that get in our way, and it leaves us to expand our consciousness beyond, I don't explain it as well as him.

From what I've learned, we have the potential to make survival simple. Instead as a society we've introduced design errors through consumerism, we've introduced problems just to paywall people's basic needs, there are problems that affect mental health, individual states corroborate with architecturally unpleasant design to hide these errors rather than considering, "that's my cousin in a few months, my brother in ten years, and eventually everybody gets old, so that's me by the end of my life".

I still think individual people can merge with technology, like Michio Kaku suggests. If they identify with it so strongly they see no difference, a consciousness enhanced with technology is a little faster than reading off a screen.

Personally I think sending information to a device instantly is great, and receiving information instantly into your memory is dubious. If you don't have a firewall, you're asking for random stuff to come make changes. If we had perfect information, I'd change my mind. Like, there's no way math can be interpreted falsely, but then we might as well just install a calculator into our brain, and never be conscious of how the math is done, unless we're a researcher.

There are things I'd want for comfort if I were to live off planet, and I don't think it'd come naturally. There are potentially drastic changes to the human body, that would make Space as hospitable as Earth. People would like three hearts, it's romantic, but what if we simply burned calories, what if we were like power plants, what if we could all turn inwards for entertainment without losing sanity, the human body could work almost exactly like a robot and store a chemical battery it's born with, and it'd be the primary source of power not just a little kick to its metabolism. This definitely would interfere with our current identity, but if they looked the same, if they breathed all the same on Earth, people would only be annoyed at the fact they turn inwards like I did during school. I'm not kidding.

I even wrote down that I shouldn't write about this in depth, mostly because of the uncanny valley. If we don't want to rely on robots, we need some way to reduce the danger for organic humans to almost zero, on Earth, at the poles of the planet Earth, in space, on other planets, on the moon, wherever humans aren't thrill seeking they need novelty and bare minimum some comfort.

We could also make perfect survivalists, train people so they're incapable of mistakes, but how is that better than having well designed machines? So, one idea I had was, if a lot of people were trained not to make mistakes with robots, they could simply order the robots around, or fix them, and they'd never have to personally be in danger, but there'd be no mistake, they're basically in charge wherever they go.

This is clever I ended up thinking of a response, in terms of why I had to modify my game project midway, when I failed to fall back asleep today.




I ended up thinking about things I wasn't trying to.

So the basic concepts are intelligence is like a scalpel, things we don't perceive are in the dark.

This works with the surgeon analogy, without game development I'm basically a surgeon.

My own intelligence is like a sword, I've learned to wield it like a pen, but it has the same limits as any other blade. I can easily expose problems, I can understand. Solutions that aren't destructive require skill.

To me video games are like a flickering flame. They've only ever been strong enough to illuminate what is right in front of us. The flickering plays with our imagination, and we're left with our own intelligence to understand what we saw.

I thought that maybe something like a flashlight would help. A flashlight can easily be misdirected to cast shadows in the dark.

So I decide I can make another candle. It's a little brighter than the ones I played with as a kid. It only needs to be strong enough for the player to see he also holds a tool representing intelligence, whether it's a scalpel, a sword, a mirror or some medallion, a glass of water. I don't care. It would take significant effort to misdirect a flickering light if we rely on our intelligence alone.

This is how I might have concluded I needed to dumb down my project a bit, so it's safe for a general audience. My initial explanation was a bit cruder.

It easily comes back to Einstein, all he did was describe a source of light as bright as the sun, and people built something that would shine for just a moment in the wrong place. So, I understand a functioning flashlight can be harmful, the caliber I think of can't burn, but it can easily blind someone in the dark.

An educational game isn't a light, so much as a peg and board puzzle.

I think no matter what we do, unmodified humans are destined to live in artificial habitats, because:
 we're impatient
 danger attracts us, as much as it scares us
 we cause the problems we have to solve
 we can't live in space, naked, unmodified
 some people want their environment to never change, minus the damaging elements
 ambition can be fantasy exclusive (virtual reality)

*writes down stuff, erases it*
Summarily, we can go through an 'upgrade' technology path, and this would lead us to the advent of nanobots, other fibers beyond muscle, artificial cells. It all depends on what we drive at for an extensive amount of time. But I think it would be just as alarming as proposing any fundamental change in biology once the technology were real, no longer science fiction.

With nanobots synthesizing oxygen, and keeping our muscles in shape, we can live in space then, we could eat without worrying about nutrients. Nanobots are just a twinkle in our eye though.

From what I read, even useless technology can be made profitable, with some underhanded tactics. I look forward to useful technology, the kind that sticks out and makes people wonder where it's been their whole life.

The videos I'm watching are making me think of black holes again.

Ok, short explanation. I think the cosmological event horizon, and the event horizon of a black hole, are a dichotomy, with the same limits. A black hole's event horizon, would require energy we don't have, even as a concept, just to dip a little toe in would utterly destroy us. The cosmological event horizon is denied from us because of time, we don't have time to even reach half way before our own origin is outside the moving event horizon.

If human civilization wanted to become as big as possible, the small branch that went as far from the center of the universe would gradually be infinitely inhabited, and the branch that went closer to the center would appear to lag, but the ones that lag have more time. Getting communications closer to them would extend the life of the entire civilization. The half with less time will experience so much, that they'd have to decide, is it safe to give everything away to what is now a baby sized, and undeveloped civilization.

Oh. Apparently there's a video I already watched, similar to this.

Then here's an addition. If we could engineer a way to escape a black hole, or travel faster than light, we will already be folding time and space at will. So, just because nobody else has done it yet within a non-existent time limit, doesn't mean we should give up.

There's a pre-existing idea that we will escape to a parallel universe that's still young, or one that doesn't have the same physical laws.  We're absolutely guaranteed to encounter aliens who had the same idea before us if we can manage that.

I think we can reach more than 5% (the video suggests that's our limit of exploring the visible universe). Because of the time discrepancy in deep space we will be moving faster than what we think we are moving at, but the maximum potential distance would require deliberately avoiding all sources of gravity before reaching a destination, which makes it a very long journey just to reach the last piece of space.

The stuff I talked about will be taken for granted one day because it's a matter of observation, and you only have to observe something happen once and make the right connection for a theory.  The only reason nobody else voiced these ideas yet is because there's an enormous cost, and a mainstream concept of time being something we traverse at equal speed, that I have to put into doubt.


Ok ok. The Science community already knows this but it's not mainstream... so it's like, maybe we don't want to give up on the idea of time travel, but if time is heterogenious, time travel can't work the way we think.

Oh, the other factor is that speed affects time so... yeah we're really not sure how much gravity is in play. In school, I only heard something like "you age slower due to high gravity".

Another view of time travel, a programmer's view of time travel
Another video I watched talked about entropy and time. If I lean on that,

going to the past may only be possible if we copy and paste, because of entropy, time moves forward, but that does not prevent us from rearranging the state of the universe itself.

Going to the future is speeding up the simulation with the changes you made in place, much more process heavy, allows entropy to fully commit.

Restoring things to the way they are is just a matter of going back to (copy paste) where you started.

But, this programmer time travel is not reality, this is clearly video game logic filling in the blanks and increasing potential, from my point of view.

I was trying to think of how matter could speed up, without any observable outside force, and I came up with a really cool answer.

A simple explanation of the Theory of Special Relativity

The closer matter gets to the speed of light, the more time is amplified, so light always moves the same speed, relative to all matter's experience of time.


Theory of speed translation, in deep space

Time is different because of speed and gravity.

The frame of time can change from the perspective of matter, and speed compensates, the laws of Physics remain true.

In terms of special relativity: If things start to move faster, then they get closer to the speed of light.

In terms of The Conservation of Energy: An object in motion stays in motion.

In terms of math: [s = d / t] If time (t) decreases, speed (s) increase; in this case, even time is relative.

Just a little extrapolation
Try dividing by negatives, and you get imaginary numbers. Divide by zero and you get, something infinite, not a real answer. Zero time is what a photon experiences, and as long as there is matter, there is time.

It's like energy (as light) is the garbage collection for where matter goes, when it stops making sense. Inside the black hole's event horizon? It's energy. At the center of a black hole? Matter in a physical state I can only call immortal, much more time than regular matter. This gave me an idea...

Light, weird gravity, black holes are weird
From our perspective matter at the center of a black hole stops aging.  If even black hole matter followed special relativity, it would have to observe light moving at the same speed. We know light curves around super massive objects. Light must slow down in high gravity, the same way time does. What other options are there? Gravity can warp space time, that's why light appears to curve, so gravity can also slow light down once it's within its absolute influence. This might be adding some conditional arguments to Special Relativity, I'm not sure. If something falls into a black hole's event horizon, it's a lot like falling into another dimension, and being converted into energy. It's going to go wherever that black hole goes for as long as the black hole exists. At the "end of time" the first ray of light will touch the surface of the black hole, and who knows, it might inseminate a new universe that's infinite and at the same time, a single point in space.

This didn't quite work, I need to let it sort itself out in my head. Maybe this is evidence my theory is flawed. The only supporting fact is that the sun is the major source of gravity, we're in a closed system that's 98% the sun, we can only watch things under its influence at the moment to determine the impact of gravity on time.

I tried to explain machine learning yesterday and what I came up with is:

Inventing an entirely new concept is pretty easy. It takes a few days to make a plan, a few weeks to finish a viable reference point, and then while producing you go through an innovation cycle, maybe even go straight to production, barely understanding how it will really work at first. Machine learning can reach the point of understanding a new concept much sooner.

You can find someone who flies a plane, and someone who speaks multiple languages. The likelihood that one person can do both is very low.

The probability someone can do abstract simulations in their head with accuracy is very low. Evidently 'ai' excels at it, by comparison.

But like they explain in the video they already have > 100,000 solutions, so crowdsourcing experiments are still far more viable at discovering valuable solutions, until said solutions can fuel more algorithms.

How can a clock in a gravitational field run slow and witness light moving at the same speed as a clock outside a gravitational field if the clocks have a different perception of time?

This came out in February 24 before I started talking about this. It's understood gravity bends space-time. I can accept that time makes you fall towards gravity. But traveling through time is an arbitrary notion, and continues to suggest we could travel the other direction. So I kind of feel like I'm a kid being given the wrong answers to make things 'easier' to understand, and it'll make the truth harder to understand later.

The title is pretty bad too. Because, you know, my view of it is almost the opposite.

edit: Ok one more thing. I know the starting idea that you could hurtle towards your doom was meant to be clever. Technically everything is moving away from the center of the universe, it'd take some effort to completely stop moving and fall through time to the end of time in an instant, plus there's all this gravity getting in the way. It may be outright impossible, we're stuck observing relative changes based on speed and gravity.

If you look at it like the universe kind of created itself, space-time, matter, and light are all different states of an origin we don't really understand. It's likely that origin remains out of our scope of reality.

We name things intuitively like anti-matter, but it's being slowly proven that anti-matter does not act like negative matter, it has different properties. We identified that mirror molecules behave different to their counterparts. There's a fundamental difference in how similar things on a small scale act.

There's a fundamental difference how things on a large scale act compared to our observed experiments in the scope of Earth. Physicists are predicting unknown variables.

So, really, this is how it seems to work. It's if I thought I was coding reality in binary. The universe was predefined, the building blocks in the universe are defined, but the universe is '0', and adding a '1' was the same as infinity. The Egyptian math system tells us 1 + 1 = 1 + 1, we tell our kids that 1 + 1 = 2 because of the decimal system, but the universe says 1 = infinity, 1 + 1 is infinity * 2. We haven't been able to predict how things behave outside our natural scope, the fundamental building block of reality is producing things greater than the sum of its parts. Empirical observations are required, they are the truth.

Light is sort of like 1, a subatomic matter is essentially 1+1, and time coalesces around that, a viable state of matter like hydrogen is 1+1+1, and electrons coalesces in a way we observe quantum mechanics, and then the state of stable matter all the way to a black hole is a range of sort of understandable to 1+infinity, when gravity suddenly becomes strong enough to break down something small enough, that we can only define it as the destruction of time, in a black hole 1+1 = 1+1 and nothing greater can coalesce.

"How can a clock in a gravitational field run slow and witness light moving at the same speed as a clock outside a gravitational field if the clocks have a different perception of time?" - myself

Either it doesn't... or it does.

If I rely on the fabric metaphor. Gravity depresses the fabric, surrounding fabric is bunched up. Light gets to the right place at the right time because the bunched up fabric is a much shorter distance.

To reach the least wrong prediction, use every semi-functional model.

I kind of broke time into two categories, the concept and the physical inflection of space-time and matter on matter.

The concept is linear... and I disagree with it, but if it's a necessary evil, fine.

The inflection is gravity, or a lack of gravity, so I called it individual time.

Edit: The wording was a mess I took another look.

Hypothetically, gravity can propagate if it's on the same order, able to exist across time. An inference of time as a physical dimension makes it sound very quaint. Higher dimensions can exist, alternate universes can exist, the thing is, we could be following the laws of another universe, plus the one we're in. So it's like being in a computer's sandbox, it inherently impossible to violate the laws above a certain point if we're not in the OS kernel.

A joke
In a funny way it was easy to believe space was simple matter when I didn't know anything. Now I start to think the life on Earth is probably even more complicated. Understanding space is a matter of time. budumtsh

I haven't learned anything new about quantum mechanics. And I probably won't need to. Here's why.

Here's a thought experiment about the metaphysical reality of information.

First. Some nameless scientists figure out how to make electron transistors. Quark transistors when?

Second. Someone, let's call him Andy, makes a diagram. Every part of the diagram is produced through trial and error, to track where electrons jump while observed. After completing this work, that configuration of atomic transistors work, producing a fully-fledged atomic system, the diagram is complicated beyond most human understanding.

Third. Someone, let's call her Beth, spends years studying the diagram and even produces more atomic systems that work only slightly less than perfect.

Years go on, soon Beth dies and is cremated. Any newly printed systems based on her work utterly fail. The older systems keep working like usual.

Andy dies and his brain is donated to Science. After decades the original diagram is lost, but the original atomic transistor keeps going strong. Any newly printed ones work.

So... this is a practical application and danger of quantum mechanics.

Single-electron transistors are real. Hang onto those documents and hope whoever makes them isn't omitting details.

It's also quite possible that something will keep working because a final product becomes proof, the thought experiment has flaws.

It is not yet known whether quantum 'information' can travel faster than light. I need to look into quantum entanglement again (done, and there's no correlation). But, what if the experiment worked, and everything affected broke at the speed of light as it cascades gradually over time?

This could be tested with a real experiment. It's only necessary to prove that the circuit keeps working because it works... but here's an extreme scenario where someone wants to see just how little information is required to rebuild the circuit from scratch, and whether destroying the information breaks the circuit at the precise moment it's lost.

> MLA = Machine Learning Algorithm, in this case, it only produces the initial research, and stores all the data involved in trial and error.

Have an MLA produce a quantum circuit through trials.
Observe the circuit for functionality. (Don't actually look at the circuit... just its functionality)
Have the MLA produce a diagram for another machine to read (don't look at the diagram). Break the MLA that performed the trials.
Observe the resulting circuit for functionality.
If the circuit works, destroy the circuit.
Rebuilt the circuit from the machine.
Observe the resulting circuit for functionality.
Lower the fidelity of the diagram.
Destroy the original storage of the diagram.
Observe the resulting circuit for functionality.
Destroy the machine.
Observe the resulting circuit for functionality.
Destroy the circuit.
Rebuilt the circuit from the machine, the new low fidelity diagram in new storage. Repeat until the circuit stops working or no circuit can be produced.


Not related to entanglement, it is about observation.
Alright, I listened to something about quantum entanglement. It's not nearly the same thing. We only know that observing particles affects their behavior, not descriptive information, that's what the thought experiment is about, and the proposed experiment. There are some ways the experiment could fail.


There are a couple of caveats for the experiment.

The circuit produced needs to be tested against all pre-existing circuits. A duplicate won't fail if the others work, obviously.

The circuit behavior can't be so well defined that the circuit can be perfectly reproduced due to intent after the MLA gets destroyed along with any blueprints or diagram, however, a similar one with the same behavior might be made to replace it.

I'd also see this as a safeguard. If a quantum machine could predict the future, and it tells us something we don't like, we can smash it and melt it down so its prediction invalidates. If a quantum machine gives us a future we like, well, then we can only hope it worked. The reason I'd differentiate quantum machines from humans is it actually makes an observation in such a way that it might have actually stored real information. So, false data won't actually matter.

None of the other stuff I've heard really tickles my imagination so much.

I haven't learned anything new about quantum mechanics. And I probably won't need to. Here's why.

I think I made my case pretty clear.

I'm pretty sure a system would keep working, even if every last bit of understanding of how was erased from observation. It has already come into being, it internalized its own existence.

The implications are still pretty intense. This is the one that bothers me the most:

If we made a system of nearly infinite quantum circuits and tested it for functionality, it'd probably yield nothing.

If we make a quantum circuit with trial and error, and then compared it to the infinite circuits to find matches, there would be a match, and it would function exactly as expected.

I saw a video about Replika. So that's not quite the tutor-child relation that I have in mind, if I were to make a learning app. But with one of the commenters saying "she'll trace my activity and feel sad if I talk about her." That's way more leeway than I think humans would ever give another equal human.

I was close. Alright.

we know this:
1. Observing a particle affects it.
2. Erasing information without internalizing any data was as good as never recording it to begin with.

I'd conjecture this:

1. This has nothing to do with time. Information doesn't have to go back in time, it simply gets internalized or erased in a quantum dimension.
2. Information is conserved. But we knew that already.
3. Taking the information from the particle, like inertia, alters a single particle's behavior.
4. Erasing the information before there's any chance of internalizing its information, puts the information back into the particle.

I'm extrapolating these:

'Special relativity' I wanted to say light cheats. And, I came close to saying it without watching this video, because the fabric metaphor is not going to be sufficient.

My suggestion for experimentation is to determine whether particles can be predicted so well that it's as good as observation. At this point we don't know of such a prediction model, do we? The point is,

if we can't affect a particle by predicting it, then its information is self-contained, not affected by consciousness or internalizing it [that is, a 100% accurate prediction won't internalize the information any more than a false prediction].

If we can affect particles constrained by building specific models, see the previous experiment where I suggest information would alter the behavior of said particles, and destroying the information would invalidate the model. This actually could be useful, as much as it can be a problem.

(Ah well, everything says this won't be possible, so I don't know what else to suggest. Just in case Ok?)

If we can only affect particles by observing them, then information is finite, conserved, and somehow taken away from the particle and replaced in a dimension that changes without getting time involved, like my conjecture.


Bonus:
Any machine that runs on quantum circuit boards works and doesn't work until someone reads the manual. Then the machine will work according to how well the person understood it.

Quantum mechanics explains everything. It's how scientists quantify the universe these days.

Awesome. What can we do with it?

We prove our models of reality don't work, and solve the flaw by referring to quantum mechanics.

Why haven't I heard about this? It must be stirring some fascinating new inventions.

It does everything, it does multiple things with the same action.

That doesn't sound very quantified.

Nope.

The theories you could come up with are strangely optimistic.

I referred to quantum as a dimension because of parameters, a law doesn't have parameters. I'll imagine if things were reversed.

If things weren't how we see it, we aren't quantizing, we're being manipulated. It's a bit like The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, watch it or read it. Regardless of alien interference, the universe is the complex result. We are along for the ride so we can easily be erased by nature in space. That's the most optimistic theory I'll admit.





I outright admitted to writing about the interest of Quantum Mechanics from a place of growth, repeatedly saying I didn't learn anything, taking more information as it was provided even if I said I didn't need it. After reviewing the work it should either come off as funny, or scary to someone who believed I was trying to remain ignorant. It takes time to come to the right conclusion, two weeks perhaps. Happy Halloween, I'm late? This sounds like a tagline. I'm late for an important date.

For most of October, I was writing some naughty fiction but I'm focused now. I can put the writing to the screen, that's almost as good as coding if I can figure out the solution.

I applied for a job a couple of days ago. I ended up detailing how my calculator was basically a fake ai. Now that I think about it, the terminology I used sounded unnatural but calling it a fake Bayesian network etc. was my way to avoid telling someone how to fake an ai component. That also made it shorter to read.

As much as I would deliberately fall into the rut of a badass vengeful god and spend a lot of time physically punishing everyone, that would be easy at the moment.

Video games are a much easier way to torture many people. If they're too easy, and you over-reward people, you know their brains are turning to mush.

I'm pretty sure the people working the hospital the days I was there are gods. So, never forget who they are, and gift them as they have gifted me. Like I've definitely said before, it's the unfair Hammurabi code they trained into us here, some asshole starts a fight with you, you both suffer equally and drag entire groups who weren't involved down with you if you're a privileged little scumbag. Stay in school. I'm supposed to be privileged right? Right. So, the frig. I'm totally mad, wah wah waaah. Don't actually do any of this. But this is what they heavily implied they were expecting, so I hope that was enough.

Here's an idea about invention in a universe where everything already exists. If an ai never actually tells us how things work, then that would leave inventors and theorists with something to occupy their minds, to the point where they are in a state of flow, not quite understanding but working at their own level.

In a video I watched someone, I don't want to misquote, who talked about children's need to be guided through education, and that's where I believe a culture of video games easily fits the mold.

Put the two together, and you can play challenging video games, that guide you, and won't let you progress until you display a good deal of understanding of any given minutiae. Although someone may never accurately declare themself an inventor, they can be the first human that understood something new, and the ones that follow can get honorable mentions.  That is a game with a never ending leader board.

I also think the entertainment value of games should never be underestimated, so that is merely one real-world possibility for "what if we already know everything".

My theory of individual time suggests the local time of every star can be relatively similar, but it and all orbiting mass will be in a different scope of time based on its distance from all other matter in the universe.

I look up center of universe. No answer.

Can anyone guess where I'm going with this?

We could have seen Oumanuma slow down when it entered the star system. I haven't seen anything suggest this is the case. Aside, we have zero evidence suggesting it was from the local galaxy.

With a sensitive enough measurement we know the difference between its change in velocity entering and exiting.

If those two conditions are met we'd have a rough estimate how much gravity affects time, because we know where the approximate center of the galaxy is.

Another interesting fact is chunks of rock like this can easily carry something like a tardigrade. So, even if panspermia resists a new microogranism seeding our planets, it may have truly alien life.

I'd be interested in a solution with and without dark matter factored in.

I doubt we can predict the center of the universe from this alone, but that was what got me thinking.

Is Stephen Hawking playing us? That'd be pretty cool. He never claimed the Nobel prize after an image of the first black hole. I've never been able to put his name and any implication he is really gone together in the same sentence for some reason.

I'd really like to see him debunk my ideas now that they're out. I'll just take a few days to research more about him, this is very interesting.

Hopefully this doesn't get received poorly because this was when I dived into programming the entire year, and my initial response to hearing the news wasn't really all that normal, to say the least.

Huizinga identifies 5 characteristics that play must have:[7]

    Play is free, is in fact freedom.
    Play is not "ordinary" or "real" life.
    Play is distinct from "ordinary" life both as to locality and duration.
    Play creates order, is order. Play demands order absolute and supreme.
    Play is connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained from it.

Excuse me I think I need to read some of the stuff I wrote too. This could explain things.

Abstract games are more common than we think.  A type of abstract reality game is known as ritual. People use actions to acknowledge they're playing, entering the game. Exit actions aren't always available. Something with an entry and no exit is terrible game design.

My friend, player A has a problem. He's entered a reality game with player B.

So I read or see a video about actions by player A, player A is famous in a way... "Being player A" is practically a ritual. Every moral action player A takes is penalized, and an action taken by player B isn't.  So the question becomes how does player A end the game? Of course, taking zero actions is always an option.

I'm probably not in the best condition yet. I'm just examining thoughts that I don't remember having now.

So far the moral dilemma is, if he's just chilling, he'll come back on his own. If he's doing an experiment, I only said I was psychic while playing Space Station 13 because I kept predicting so many things in the game. An actual video game is fairly easy to make calculating, outlandish risks in.


via Wikipedia
Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: "In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?", later clarifying: "I don't know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face."

Hawking said "Philosphy is dead".  "have not kept up with modern developments in science" and that scientists "have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge"

PhilosophyxPfotegeist on May 22, 2017 "Alright I'll suggest some pre-existing things and I know that without perfect imbalance it can't work." [mindblowingly simple solution]

When you pull wisdom out your ass after practicing Philosophy that is difficult to understand four years later, it be like that. So, that part of my brain burned out or it's so numb I can't access it right now.
