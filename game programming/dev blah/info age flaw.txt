I've been subconsciously considering what the greatest failing of the information age might be. The average literate person now lives in an environment free of information scarcity. Avant garde, people of science and art (but not limited to those fields) live in a world of low information scarcity, and continue to intrigue and grow the pool of information.

The flaw is what's not provided, what needs to be directly taught.  The knowledge of literacy for example.  If someone's not taught how to read, if they aren't told there's something great about it, they'll never live in the same environment that the internet provides.

Literacy is common education in Western schools.  School, is flawed, limited, and as socially dangerous as a prison.  But parents aren't always capable of teaching, so it's very difficult to determine what's morally justified.

The flaw is probably that in the information age, there's no guarantee that any given individual will strive for any more than they're told they should, to be considered fulfilled. To be as smart as a stupid computer and stick signs out of a web address are common tools, that creative people enjoy, and that alone can seem like a hassle so it must be special, the epitome of humanity for some.  

The ability to recognize a lack of information is almost non existent.
