It's really a personal desire for someone to want to call themselves an artist, and if they delve into uncommon skill sets.

For enjoyment, extra skills are nice for inspiring yourself some way.

For functionality, secondary skills directly feeding into a final product aren't always noticeable. A unique skill is unlikely to be a hiring point. The less your impact is going to be on the final project the less visible that skill is. This is why indie games are interesting to me.


(Before the following takes effect there must be a game medium, I'm assuming that is already handled)

For you, I'd recommend aiming towards an SRPG related skill, or skills, if you know of any, it may help simply knowing there's such a thing.

You might start with building scenarios using multiple drafts, as long as the medium communicates the scenarios clearly to yourself and you start to master the creative flow. If you plan on working with a team, start learning to communicate it to them after you understand what you're doing. You won't need to look for advice on SRPG scenarios, and as long as this is more like a hobby to inspire your programming you're less likely to encounter creative burnout.
