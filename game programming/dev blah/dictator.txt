I'm not trying to be overcomplicated. Here I'll contribute directly to some rebel Ideas. I think this'll help.

First I'll brainstorm some targets that rebels could somehow take over for their own benefit, or simply to break you down.

I put question marks next to stuff that's probably going to once again overcomplicate things.

ZONING 

residential living space
(easily convertible to army barracks)
see classes of citizen
also shelters / hospitals / schools

FOOD / SUPPLIES
farms
depots
Transported goods
research and medicine
computers?/power grids? (assuming we're in a 1st world society just this time)
weapons

TRAVEL / MIGRATION
(most things here can also be guarded and overtaken by your army / at the expense of citizen morale hitting an all time low)
transit
vacation / tourism locations
migration processing
identification

YOU

CITIZEN CLASS
royalty?
land owners
middle class
serf (slave)

POWER IN NUMBERS
police
army
see citizen class



Now that I've thought of some targets. The rebel faction(s) are assumed to be sustainable if they acquired any one of these from the get-go. Sustainability simply implies they're not going to give up.

In the long-run if their numbers grew higher than your army, while maintaining an infrastructure they've captures, they'd definitely win at that point.

Any short term goals would involve attacking and capturing supplies. Starving citizens in an area you lose would quickly join them. More weapons has the obvious benefit of making their attacks deadly, which reduces the effectiveness of your army. 

All things in-between having its own benefit.

In order to survive some people like to travel. The economy can enjoy tourism to increase capital. When these things go away, people start to get really annoyed. The rebels will also need to travel in the same manner so it is proactive to restrict travel with checkpoints. 

Guerillas can be a nomadic group who survive without shelters and constantly change their identity and recruit just enough people to keep running, and thus they aren't visible to police, nor would they attack the army head-on. They could severely damage any of the above targets if they're left unchecked for long anyway.

Afterthought.

A full blown transit shutdown will quickly starve everyone to death in a matter of weeks. Realistically this is one possible way how the game would end with you surviving as a continuing dictator.

Then a superpower will stick their foot in the door, see you have everyone under control and try to assassinate you.
