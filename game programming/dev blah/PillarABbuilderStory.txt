THE SCIENTIFIC PART
Summary: two pillars are being built. Pillar A supports a wall which saves the town infrastructure. Workers keep the wall up by rebuilding it. While Pillar A is up, the workers can work on other things.


Design:
Actors by Priority:
	Pillar A
		supports wall
	Wall
		protects infrastructure
	Pillar B
		supports wall permanently
	Infrastructure
		supports town
	Workers
		rebuild one thing at a time


	The actors exist, they become a subject of the story acting on them.
	
Program:
	The workers ... could be a semaphore variable in an ai manager class, an actual animated object, it depends on what I'm going for here (it's not clear in this example yet)
	
	A building class with variables. 
	optional: A graphic class (pretty standard utility now)
	
	overkill: A professional game development suite. :D
	

Story Conflict:
	Pillar B needs to be built.
	
	Pillar A falls down frequently because it is directly facing hurricane winds.
	Wall is damaged as long as Pillar A is down.
	The infrastructure is damaged slightly, just from existing.
	
Positive Resolution:
	Pillar B is built.
Negative Resolution:
	The town is destroyed.
