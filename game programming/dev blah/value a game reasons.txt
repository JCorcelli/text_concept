What makes someone see value in a game? If I think about the ways I could see value there's a possibility I'll understand.

1. projection, someone else values it so I do.
2. relative functionality, I don't suck at it so I think the game works.
3. expectation, I'm excited before I play it due to some external motivator.
4. impressions, I'm confident in the product or the developer because of a specific quality in art direction.
5. in-game promise through narrative, I imagine greater potential from the options I'm given (I forget a lot of small promises I imagined over time).
6. challenge:reward that I can appreciate, it's a game I can relate to, it requires a skill i have and rewards me with more content
	logic: wrong solutions, few correct solutions
	action: change of pace, lots of flexibility in solutions
	patience: view, movie pace
	practice: experience, I get better at a skill
	aggression: aggression, retaliation or equivalent action somewhat logical.
	success: higher points, I can play for a sense I deserve something, even if it makes no sense.
7. relative content skill gap, I understand the effort to make it.
8. social interference, I am told how to feel so my opinion is amplified (If I already like it to begin with it's good).
9. art content, there are many interesting things in it.
10. i can do many things, agency.
11. obstacles that make sense, big or small.
12. I can escape reality, escapism.
13. I can learn new things, autodidact-ism.
14. After the game is over there's bonus content, unlocked content, replay content, or a new similar game that adds nothing to the original directly.

15. In-game promise being met, I discover something unexpected or I forgot.

some fallacy
A. Games have value. Any game that's not a malicious copy has value.  A game that's not made has value.

B. Meet expectation, binary evaluation.  If the game session meets expectation, it's good, otherwise it's bad.  I can't really differentiate between the game and the game session.

C. However I felt that day influences my opinion.
