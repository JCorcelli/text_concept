I've got a new human fallacy to catalogue.  I believe I've heard something like "people who perform better at tasks aren't just faster, they take fewer steps."  What I'm mentioning here is the "why" that matters.

First I'm going to describe a process. When someone gets it, and when someone doesn't. Then I'll ask what's likely to be blamed for the difference in outcome now?  How likely is it that something else can be blamed? What can be done?

So the problem here is understanding of meaning and pattern recognition for outcome.  A processes uses patterns, aka algorithms, to produce an outcome.


A lot of the time, we want to learn or teach someone these processes, and they either will or won't understand right away.  When the entire process is fundamental to us, we say it's common sense.  Although the process itself could be complicated.

However when each step is fundamental a person will "get it" and the entire process takes time to memorize.
 
When a step is complex, a person will find the process difficult, even if there's only one step. When someone fails to replicate an entire process, maybe it's too complex, or maybe it's not fundamental. 

So now things are blamed. The problem becomes entirely subjective for unknown individuals.  Can the person not understand? Is the process difficult? Is a single step complicated, making it complex?


There has to be some way to overcome this. While trying, people can substitute a step with their own.  If that makes a different outcome it isn't optimal. Although the outcome isn't optimal, they'll use it because it's easier than replicating an optimal step at first.

Another possibility is the value of the outcome conflicts with what a person wants, this could be motivated morally or selfishly, making their decision easier.  In this case there's a conflict of interests.  Someone will never replicate an outcome if it conflicts with their interests.  In some cases people prefer to adopt strange behaviors because it makes it all easier.
