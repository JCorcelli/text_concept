examples of the hero's journey observe the starting point and a loop that is enjoyable to view. 

I believe I've seen/heard media in recent times that is dedicated to jarring, upended narratives that are antithetical to enjoyment.

This can be chalked up to dark humor.

Star wars: Luke skywalker sucked at lightsabre duelling, but he was willing to save his father. In the end Luke was accused of thought crimes and secluded himself, sick of this shit.
