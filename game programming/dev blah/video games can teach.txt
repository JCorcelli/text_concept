in terms of media potential the ability to spread its content is on point.  Should be researched ... this is a very awkward starting paragraph.

a newspaper could guarantee an idea gets reinforced, information is spread, for those with firsthand experience an idea is all they need to take it on faith.

watching a short film you guarantee everyone has an experience, which has an uncanny affect on people new to films. However, ensuring that the audience remains motivated beyond childhood is outside this, viewers learn their role is passive, and maybe a few talk to engage their frontal cortex and reason with what they're learning.

next up are video games. A viewer is motivated, otherwise the film won't go. This essentially guarantees that one side of the action is initiated, that's commitment.  Players still risk being misled, information without time to digest and test it is dangerous.

finally there's a flexibility in media. Source material can be outside the box; Words are challenging even in context; a film can be very long, confusing, or just dumb; and video games can skill lock all content, inheriting the strengths and weaknesses of other media.
