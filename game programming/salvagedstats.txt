On my Plate
	drawing bunnies for emotional, personality expression
	visuals
	design the text-bubbles for story
	
	doors that open... physics (cleaner) or scripted (faker)?
	doorway information, for occluded rooms
	
	
	occlude individual rooms
	! when npc is near door
	
	
	
Additional design or scripting
	waypoint A* taking agent size into account
	wandering character, for small bursts
	wandering character, using the A* or other waypoints for events
	HUD, what is purpose other than debug?
	
About Unity
	packaged Event System for button presses
	image effects like antialiasing
	alternative to physics, character controller
	
	effects
	trail renderer - won't need to 'draw' anything myself
	line renderer - requires two positions
	projector - casts materials onto objects, like a cool shadow
	
	COOL http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Scripts/Controllers
	
Visuals
	
	if all else fails, destroy symmetry, create disorder
	
	
Require Adjusting / Redecorating
	text-bubble script uses ( not mine )
	CAMERA
		SmoothRotate - look between two objects (awesome #1), Look from center of room, look at center of room. look from bunny at goal (overly directed). capture gaze by forcing look
	I can put the camera frame on a zipline and smoothly transition it 
	postprocessing effects on camera, multiple camera + effects for effecting separate room
Require Scripting
	stylish drop shadow (animated)
	safe in prop (exit positions), refocus narrow to the prop location
	camera tricks &
	switching camera FOR SPECIFIC REQUIRED EFFECTS

	REMINDERS

	DONE
	tired
	awake time remaining
	hidden
	hidden by prop
	exit is safe
	near door
	current room
	known rooms
	known rooms (stale)

Extraneous
	texture doorways - I have real walls, and I have real doorways, this only sounds like a good idea for modularity or magic portals. Or bunnyhole cutouts.
	lerping color intensity to simulate light, or animated textures
	2D minigame diversions - think converting 2D program to 3D space on a plane and changing the game's controls
	interactive textures OR decals in game
	HUD - for text and safe visual effects
	being cute "opens doors" also literally
	mini story - "resist the carrot"
	camera movement through waypoints and arrayed sensors
	camera layering
	check tween class for huge array morphing: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Tween
	check mouse gesture class: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Gesture_Recognizer
	for board-games. A 2d grid based movement: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/GridMove
	entire outer-world hub as a racetrack
	

"JUICYNESS" (as described at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)
special effects actually
do not understate the impact
	color
	animation
		impact
			stretching
			flashing colors
		movement
			tweening
			easing
	randomness
	sound
	particles (eg puff of smoke, trails)
	personality - face expressions

defined frame rules for 2D-card animations
	#1 all frames must be the same size
	#2 animation oriented interactions need to encompass the area they'll appear in. (no extra programming, just position and play)
	#3 use a single time base for all time-related events

	tips
	#1 tip (render 15fps)
	#2 tip reserve pallette colors, if limited?
	#3 tip approximate shadows, to see where something touches ground
	#4 connect loops and transitions with the final frame (duh?)
	#5 use fewest expressions necessary and make them on a seperate layer
	#6 vary sharpness and saturation to enhance depth illusion
	#7 moving hold, avoid it by having some part continue to move
