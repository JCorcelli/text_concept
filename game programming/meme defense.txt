I change my mind.

If a person erases all known traces of a meme, there's no evidence they'll remember it. The person who is in charge of the meme is no longer held responsible for its use. And that's final.

People who continue to uphold memes past any experiation are blamable, and therefor the memes that hinder anyone they convince to reuse or enact on them shall rebound, like magic.

This is a permanent effect which society will believe is called "common fucking human decency." Or some combination of the words.

This remains in effect until I disspell the meme either by acknowledging it's being misused, itself. Or if I say "disspell meme" or the next time I say "I change my mind" giving a reference to defenses against memes.

For now this remains in effect as long as it's saved in a file. Done this way to see if there's any effect.
