This a kid, well... nevermind how he looks.  He acts like he can't relax; He ignores other students.

He appears to talk with other students confidently.

All school assignments turned in show creativity.

His behavior is unpredictable. In class he reads a book, sometimes the entire session. He's drawing too much attention.

Some of the homework assignments are so neat it's like an adult is doing them. I find it hard to believe a normal highschooler can do what he does.  Despite this there's no merit to what he says, it's almost jibberish.

All STEM class assignments are completed and acceptable.

He never works with the other students on assignments in class.

He begins an athletic career in track and field and baseball.

A brief counseling inquiry suggests he's bored with school.

He did not do his homework for the summer.

Several teachers report a misconduct because the male student appears bored in class.

He is frequently absent to school.

He attempts olympic wrestling.

One teacher reports he is a danger to her class morale and he made very little effort on an important assignment.

He misses easy assigments.  His grades fall sharply within the first semester.

semester2

"A few unusual talents, but an otherwise ordinary student who expects too much."

He writes provocative papers that spark arguments compelling examination and doesn't attempt to sugar coat any details.

"A deviant. Intentionally angers teachers who read his work."

His lack of physical ability show when he kicks a soccer ball.

He is always finishing papers last. Perhaps he is cheating.

The female students show too much interest. All of them actually. The classes he's in aren't the same.
