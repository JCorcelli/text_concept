The expenses for metal armor are above her paper budget but she is willing to sell off her gaudy jewelry and one of the beasts with her.

The armor smith is familiar with humans, but he had never met someone with a tail before. This proves to be interesting for him.

Tamara offered to try whatever is needed.

They come up with all kinds of drapery. Her armor is decided to be leather seeing how the metal wouldn't be maneuverable enough for her style. 


It turns out her ample breasts were going to hinder the preparations.  Indeed, she also had quite a large butt. She wasn't very tall, but her figure seemed to suggest a very young and prematurely developed lady.

The men prodded her greedily with their tools she could not sit still. Tam had to explain that the tail improved her balance, and she had never wielded it with any weights before, so it will remain nude. After some deliberation a few test pieces were placed around her.

The armor is ready to be made, and will take a month's time.
