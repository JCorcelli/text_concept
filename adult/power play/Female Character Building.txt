Lucy Feldt.

Ms. Feldt lives with her parents. She sees them dolphin training daily.

When her breasts grow Ms. Feldt starts to have some sexual difficulty and gets talked about a lot. She takes on brutish teenagers for sex. They call her the titmouse.

For several years her new friends play with dolphins.  She calls it emotional support. Sex with them is a daily event.

She got used to physical abuse. Her body was tough and she overcame it.

After education ended she sought a deeper meaning and became physically active.  She visited many locations, became a headhunter, talked with clients so she knew what they needed.

Pornography was in need of women in general.  They weren't picky. A magazine wanted to extort purely physical beauty, people who were willing to spend long hours satisfying others.

Ms. Feldt was kidnapped and after being hostage for a month, they told her a feminist paid for her release. She was brought to a hotel, assigned bodyguards, and she stayed there for about a week.  When a man introduced himself to her, she already knew him, he paid for all this, she was very grateful to him. [he will release a video of her in future] She went away with great memories of this place but she couldn't contact him.

She made enough money to fund a tech company with partner. She was the silent partner, but she met with the other frequently. Fucking, why else?

Her appetite for wealthy men grew.

She stopped in front of a window in daylight.

Her body was very fit. She had her chest compressed, but it was distinctly large. She checked her butt.

Someone comes out of the store.

"You are the most beautiful... I am the owner of this store, were you admiring the gowns?"

Indeed there were gowns in the window. There was even a new bridal gown a few feet away, for someone taller.
