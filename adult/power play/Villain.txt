Trapped. For the next three and a half years I can't get off this frozen wasteland.

A cabinet happens to be in the way. It's heavy. Sonja kicks over the file cabinet, the contents spill on the floor.

It's... pages of accounting.

With nothing else to do, Sonja starts reading the illegible gibberish, and saved any blank pages for fire ignition.

There was considerable hardship.

There's a page with accounting on it.

"XXX39 Sycamore St. That's the owner. The owner's name is... fake."

Hatred of the fake owner was compulsory.

...

"Hello? Is someone in here?"

A woman was trapped on an island. She was feral at fist. Soon playful, like a pet.

"Hi. I brought your favorite snack."

After eating, she'd ride me until I took off my pants.

At first she only wanted to have missionary intercourse. Now she's taking anal sex like a whore.  Sometimes she's so wet I slip right into her doggy style.

My supervisor is female and she walked in just now. I look down at my pleasure, just the tip... but that's all it takes right?

I'm fired. I get drunk, dream and have nightmares. The feral woman is in them, her ass a dick length away. I reach out and someone's holding a knife to my neck.

"Where is your cash?"

"Broke." pause "I'm broke, jobless."

Something stiff clamps around my nethers. I break out in sweat. I'm out of shape, I'm just starting to wake up. I breathe heavily. The robber speaks.

"Stiffen up fuckboy we'll be here a while."

My dick is sucked off by someone in face coverings.

"Now you see me now you don't."

It leaves.  Finally. My cock is raw and sore.  I rush to the bathroom and disinfect it.  My drug cabinet is cleaned out.

"When did this happen?"

Just three years ago. Then it came back.

I moved. I've cleaned up. I'm in better shape. Someone comes to the door.

"Hello. I'd like to welcome you to the place."

It was the neighbor.

I didn't want to have to say this but I did.

"I'm not very comfortable."

"What do you mean. Can I come in?"

Ok I let him in. He doesn't say much after entering and spends too much time looking at me. This is embarassing.

"Do you want to do something?"

I'm not sure what else to ask.

He nods. He gets closer. I just met this guy, this is rude but I think I dig him. We go to my room.

"You can relax. Fall asleep."

I do. I have a strange daydream. There's a piercing sensation and I wake up shocked. I reach down and feel his face in my lap.

"Hey. I saw this in a hentai visual novel one time."

"What the fuck! I don't want you to stay here."

"Oh. But I'll see you later, right?"

I roll my eyes. He gives head. So. I'll give him that.

"Can I crash here tonight?"

"I don't know."

I go to the bathroom to check myself out. I think deep about what just happened. He comes in.

"No. Get out."

He kisses my neck.

"Are you the fifty-shades or some kind of idiot? You don't walk in..."

"If you want me to leave. Say so. But I'm not coming back unless you let me pleasure you right now."

This is stupid.

I let him eat me out. This so stupid. He slips his finger in and does a pretty good job actually.

"Will you do me too?"

I nod.

He takes out his cock. I shake my head.

He puts it away.

"Later?"

He comes to sleep with me at night but I think one of these days he'll get me pregnant so I have to suck his cock before, to lighten the load.

"Why do you come sleep at my place all the time?"

"Can't a guy enjoy sex?"

"Are you homeless or..."

"No. Just jobless, broke. I live with my mom."

"So you eat pussy."

"I ate pussy. Before I met you."
