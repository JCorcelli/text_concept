There is something I want to buy. Can I afford it?

To make contacts and spend money reaching someone. It's called a risk venture.

With my disposable friend, we went to Muell Chika, I don't know if that's even a word, and picked up a package. It cost over a million bucks and a few years, but it was worth it.

"Having a blowjob from a girl I just met is great."

Her mouth opens pasted in white and I relax my eyes, slowly drifting to sleep while she plants sloppy wet lips around my limp shaft again.

In the morning there's a tight feeling, her fingers, encircling the tip of my penis. I pull away and I understand I'm erect. I reach down and her other hand is cupping my balls. She tightens her grip and I jerk from the sensation.

Normally I'm stuck waking up for a few minutes, or fantasize, but today it's out of my hands.

She's moving herself, and her hands, there's a rhythm, and although we didn't have sex I imagined this was close to it. She moves her head down and plants a blissfully cool ring around the spear of my dick, it goes keeper, and I picture her from last night while I fall asleep. Her throat held me for hours before I woke up again.

Her mouth finally released me, and while I dreamt, it was peaceful. 

I focused on breathing, to force myself awake.  A hot ring, this time, fire burned around my cock and I breathed and felt hot release.

"Worth every penny."
