werewolf	Oct. 9, 4:55 a.m.

TP means town protector? So I'm the asshole that heals himself. I thought it always meant transporter. Or am I four different things now? Whatever. No change.

Saruei and Shylily (second time, no issue, I'm sure I have a few more rides to go on). Saruei wants to give head, definitely. 

Ok. Gonna be a bathtub meet up. That's how my power works right?

Witches have mind control, oh. Oh...

Amnesiac. I think this is some gamebreaking stuff if it wasn't already. I don't even know all the roles in that game.

Apparently werewolf was last night. I don't remember. Oh well. Saruei got her monster husbandry. Shylily, we kind of went back and forth sharing her.
