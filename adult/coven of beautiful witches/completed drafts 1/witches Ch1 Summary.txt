BEGIN CEREMONY
In a forest cabin. Props are set up in a macabre sense. There's a frightened and excited atmosphere. Although the entire coven are witches, there are several sacrifices ready to go displayed in the most sensual manner.

There's a ceremony taking place. Witches summon a demon who they believe to be the true Devil. The Devil, actually a vampire magician, releases the sacrifices he thinks he was brought to help. He soon grasps the situation and formulates a sure way he can stay alive forever. He then describes the mission he has in plan for the witches.


NEW MANAGEMENT
new rules
#1 You can not leave the coven once you're part of it
#2 You can never kill another witch
#3 Every witch will become a vessel of power

a rash of rituals are thus introduced.

A command that The Devil bestows them is each vessel must have sex with her own victim and return to him.


REST

Introduce the head witch.
Introduce the first vessel.
Introduce important town locations.

PREP

The head witch is made a figurehead at The Devil's agreement. A rushed ceremony is held so the rest of the coven will recognize her as such.

Two vessels are given birth on the first night directly by the hand of The Devil. Along with this rebirth, they're given unusual physical traits and part of their description reveals an inner power that other witches sense.


BEGIN MISSION

Two vessels, two targets.

In a merciful act, they are made to have sex with men they already want to. They should both succeed easily due to very little being in their way, and no interruption.
