comedy / action with fem witches who summon a mischievous male vampire who they believe to be the devil


they need to have sex with young men and occasionally take an onslaught of demon lust to remain in the official coven


possible twists
dropping out of the coven is not allowed
sex is power (seems cliche for this genre)
the men they have sex with meet a twist of fate
the witches change from exposure to demons
more characters are introduced who the witches always turn out to be subservient to
the witches never really get any power, they are mere toys
