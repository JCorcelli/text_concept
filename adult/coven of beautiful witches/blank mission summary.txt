Goal oriented framework for strategic planning precluding action, and then including the results of said actions, with reflection on how to improve.

Any parallel tasks should be handled by multiple people
Namely

Rest Phase
	Review and entertainment?
Planning Phase -
	involves resting for anyone intent on operation deployment
	
	planning and preparation
	gathering info and devising tactics
	posturing
	determining what the best goal even is at any given time
	
Operations -
	involves any conflict
	decoy, feints, skirmishes
	
logistics and deployment -
	tactical maneuvers
	leveraging any information or gathered resources
	negotiating
	potentially concluding success or failure before a major turning point
	
Conflict -
	Is a deliberate confrontation 
	brute force demanding attention 
	
	the same tactic may be used as a decoy
	
	beyond the point of no return, it can't be a decoy
	
This can all be a metaphor for having sex or a strategic form of play. The planning phase itself would include some learning.
