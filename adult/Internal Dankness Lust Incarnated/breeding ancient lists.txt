I need to figure this out. Which is weird because it's my story

first gen ancients
y int
i mag
e cum
z pow

mix (story so far)
iz mag-pow

mix (potential)
ey cum-int
ei cum-mag

yi int-mag
yz pow-int

not possible as direct combo in story context (e and z are both male), possible as indirect breeding

ez cum-pow
zye pow-int-cum
ezy cum-pow-mag
ezi cum-pow-int

3x mix possible in story
yiz int-mag-pow (any order)

possible in story, but not likely
yie int-mag-cum
ize mag-pow-cum

3x mix possible in alternate timelines

eyi cum-int-mag
eiz cum-mag-pow

yei int-cum-mag
iey mag-cum-int


final mix (any y-i lead combo)
yiez

final mix can be any lead combo if one holding three powers loses to their match
