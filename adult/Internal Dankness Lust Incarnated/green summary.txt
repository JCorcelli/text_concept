ALIGNMENTS
Alignments are the glue for understanding supporting characters. Similar to role-play, a sexual alignment will determine how likely a character will behave a certain way, but SHOULD be influenced by external factors and situations. It also has a strong impact on their sexual tastes and sexual combat as follows:

pink strength > green
The pink/reddish alignment has greatest prowess in physical activity. Combat is second nature to them. They achieve strong orgasms through their own vaginal/penile stimulation, which also acts as a turn on.

blue magic > pink
The blue alignment has greatest prowess in temptation (raising curiosity). They usually voyeur and lead others to them. They are sensitive to the touch, orgasm easily, and use their voluptuous assets permissively, anus and breasts are their greatest defense.

green lust > blue
The green alignment has greatest prowess in seduction of lust (lowering inhibition). Forms of intercourse through their lips both on the genitals and in the ears. Instilling unending passion into their victims is their true pleasure, most other activities are exhausting.

black/purple bukkake cum
bukkake, futa, tentacles, vore - and other crazy shit goes down. This is the strongest and the weakest alignment.

About the gods of each alignment: pink is male; blue female; green female; black male
