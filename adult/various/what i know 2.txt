Experimental Writing Anthology

Writing creatively is ok but maybe not fun to read. I'll post random passages here, maybe I won't.

Encouraging comments encouraged.

There are a group of friends watching a brightly lit 'Smash Music'(tm) on the TV.  They each look over at the musician on the couch and their mouths curl up. Some curl their lips in, avoiding a smirk. Except Dante.

Enverik plays the plastic toy with five buttons. His face has a stone expression.

There is pause, the game is on, the chorus clapping in the virtual theatre, seconds left before the final note.  The combo on screen is perfect, 381 notes in.

Enverik grinds his dry lips and holds his shoulder up angling for style.

His audience has a sense of tension.

"And... and!!!"

Plink. The screen dims. The silent game becomes quieter, the guttural bgm dies with the chorus.

Enverik's ear hits his shoulder and rubs against it for a moment. He closes one eye to yawn and intentionally pulls his upper lip down to stretch his nostril before sitting upright.

"Dante, you're game now."[/font]
