Normal rationalization (skip to 127)
# is the hero stupid?
# Ok. Maybe. The hero is not unintelligent. He's a complicated tapestry of lessons and forces out of his control. And that's entirely our fault.
	preprogrammed things are stupid
	
	he can rationalize it later because he doesn't know he's programmed
	
	knee-jerk
	rationalization IS self defense
	
	long-term
	cyclical rationalization IS meaningless
	
	dysfunctional
	Cyclical reasoning is stupid.
	
	absurd
	if properly used, it is pornography. We understand pornography.
	
# the hero has absurd dysfunctions

	the clock strikes six pm
	
	...demon possession / psychopathy
	demon dicks, sexual dysfunction, nymphomania, body transformation.
	
	his aching erection at the sight of such beauty
	
	something will always give, he can't resist this, there isn't a person who can
	
	denial
		"I never drink, I don't have unprotected sex with strangers. I don't care about them."
	
	his denial fails
	
	...he forgets
		he does it all over again
	
	the clock strikes quarter past six pm
	his aching erection is wet, he thinks he's precum, he'd beg to put it in. 
		
	he rationalizes
		"This woman is unblievably amazing. I don't care. I have no choice but to have unprotected sex. So bad."
	
	...he's headed to his ruin
	
cyclical reasoning
	
	After rationalization.
	
	There's a mental crutch, a short-circuit analysis and conclusion.
	
	But rather than doing a short-circuit analysis, follow the malformed steps again to reach the wrong conclusion. The reason to do something stupid again will present itself logically. It'll be pornographic.
	
	"I'm paid to do a job, it's not my fault. I get paid again because I'm good at my job." - example of cyclical reasoning
	
circular reasoning
	when the starting point is the answer
	
	this can be the result of a short-circuit analysis that's finally become a tautology or a more complicated chain
	
	"I'm paid money not to think. I don't think because I'm paid money." - example of tautology
	"I'm paid money not to think. I'll lose my job if I think so I practice not thinking (logical fallacy, or instructional failure by design). I'm good at not thinking because I'm a good person. I'm paid money not to think." - example of circular reasoning
	
This could appear to be neuroticism (programmed insanity)
A more aggressive attempt to divert from logic can be psychosis (dysfunctional insanity)
narcissistic (losing interest in someone's need to understand and diverting the conversation to an unobtainable conclusion)
	by gaslighting (deliberately attacking someone mid-conversation to deny their self-interest)
	by changing the topic
sociopathic
	trying to reach a conclusion forlorn or forgone
	
	by negotiating (in bad faith) to do a favor for a little leeway
	
	offering false praise excessively for little or no gained value, over-validing someone's input, then 
	
	shutting down the conversation from further input
	by establishing an us vs them mentality and trying to separate someone from a supporting group
or even psychopathic
	
	By researching what the word neuroticism means, and hiring a lawyer.
	
	Or just have a lawyer do everything and when things go south hire anew.
	
	If the conclusion you're trying so hard for is unobtainable, it's the lawyer's fault. Nobody else. Blame the lawyers.
	
	Bitch

Example of unfun rationalization
	Philosophy - it works the way we think
	
	but it doesn't
	
	unfun rationalization is necessary. it's still rationalization, which means it's wrong.
	
	philosophy has a bad rep just because... it worked after a few million years, and it used to be called Science, science used to be religion, and religion is mythology plus a heavy dose of geneology to curb inbreeding before inbreeding was proven to cause disorder
	
	what's the problem?
	
Example of sexy rationalization
	a good example is witch riding
	
	my brain shuts off just trying to explain it
	
	saying someone grabbed a witch hat and screamed witch bitch in the middle of the night restraint-copulating a woman out in the open
	
	The first retelling of witch riding was guaranteed to be embellished, if it even happened at all. But, with practice, it can be a real thing that stupid people do.
	
Example of everyday cyclical rationalization
	"Why did you do that?"
	
	They don't know.
	
	"Why did they do that?"
	
	They don't know.
	
	"Why did _ do that?"
	
	You are repeating the question. Rationalization.
	
	Stop rationalization, when it's cyclical. It's similar enough to circular reasoning, it's not going to have a proper ending.
	


....
sexy rationalization

hang on this was about cyclical reasoning


make malformed logic sexy
There must be a starting point in order to rationalize

without involving sex | with sex

I already took it out of the bag, it's mine...
I took off her shirt, and everything below it is now mine

my penis is out

This is rationalization.
She let me suck on her tits already so I show her my penis

cyclical? - Could be normal desire or a dysfunction to need stronger stimulation.

It's good enough to eat. I have to suck harder. I want more. Sounds familiar.

circular. - Neuroticism.
She's naked, so I got naked with her... she's naked to have sex (obviously). Naked people have sex naked.

- It's pretty stupid. It sounds about what I'm aiming for.

It could be worse. In the previous examples the woman could be putting up little or no fight. But what if she denies him vocally screaming or complaining?

forcing rationalization at his cost, neuroticism
He'd argue, "You liked it." Past tense. Having already touched her. Social norms he believes in say it's ok. But more importantly, she didn't have a chance to deny him before he took physical action.

if he has psychosis he might be unable to argue, or be unable to register that she's fighting

He laughs, he'll play rough if that's her game. "Trying hard to get. Let me see if you like this." So, outright denial, sexual dysfunction that is mistaken for a lack of empathy, probably will escalate to ball-kicking if she doesn't submit right away to avoid hurting him.

narcissitic would be hearing her complain, and protecting his balls assuming her rejection at his next proposal will escalate
"The only reason we're here right now is because you're such a slut, don't tell me 'no' bitch." He has the wherewithal to avoid forcing anything on her, but has no issue pressuring her to satisfy his demands. Including drastically deterring her desire for him in the future.

entering the bad place

sociopathy 
At the very start.

reaching forlorn conclusions

"spend time with me and we'll have sex later. Deal?" - apparently this works? Fucking stupid.

false praise

"Oh wow. You're so amazing. Holy shit. I love you. You're the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyes on you've got the best tits I've ever seen. Damn! Oh wow!"

shutting down the conversation from further input

"Now shut up and take it off."

sociopathy in attempt to reaching forlorn or forgone conclusions

She definitely does not want me to keep going. Oh well.

by negotiating (in bad faith) to do a favor for a little, or a lot of leeway

"If you can do this... I swear I'll make you happy later. You won't regret this."

reaching a forgone conclusion

"anal"

by establishing an us vs them mentality

"the people who haven't done anal are really missing out. Fucking gay."

why isn't psychopathy sexier?

There are too many stupid people copycatting psychopathy from movies. They don't really know what it is. They probably don't even understand basic neuroticism, which is what they're exhibiting.

trying to make, "wanting to kill someone" sexy without qualifying it as a psychiatric disorder like copycat neuroticism

I don't want to. Pay for it. This is the end of the line.

She's really hot for me, she took off her shirt. I slip a pocket knife out and start cutting her bra. She pulls out a smithson western and cocks it, the last thing she says is, "gotcha bitch."
