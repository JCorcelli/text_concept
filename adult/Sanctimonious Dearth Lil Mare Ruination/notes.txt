SD ch3
will heavily focus on ethnicity, I'll try as hard as possible to be racist sounding in character, and though physical traits aren't stereotypes we can pretend they are, the girls have their leash lengthened enough they can finally admit they don't want to do all the things, and it gets sexist

it'll lean heavily into bondage, money, slavery, and even while the characters are unaware they're in a facsimile they're going to commit brutal carnage.

Although first these model body men will get the short end of the stick, for practice.
