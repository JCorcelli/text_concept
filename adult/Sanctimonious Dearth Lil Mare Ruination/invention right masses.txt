Any accomplishment is thanks to other people. Every single thing everyone knows, ever did, the invention and construct of society at large was done by masses and individuals larger than life.

It is thanks to you I was born. It is thanks to you I ever did or will do anything right.

And the failures, the original sin. The destruction. Good and Evil are existential. Individuals are blameless.

It is your fault I was born, it is your fault I ever did or will do anything wrong. It is your fault my children will do as they like.

Maybe you won't contribute, maybe you won't even maintain any but your own wants, but it doesn't matter. Everyone who witnesses invention stands on the shoulders of giants. The people who will invent society are not average, they have wants greater enough they'll work to get them met.

It's your fault I have rights, I blame the masses.

It's thanks to you I know what a right even is, you thank the scholar. 

If you aren't constantly reminding us, we don't know you exist, they tell the inventor.

If I am constantly reminding you what I'm doing, I can't do it, an entrepreneur tells the investor.

Do you have a fictional example or need you break the fourth wall and speak of things that shouldn't exist yet? Do it, or there's a chance it will ever progress.

Is the purpose not fiction?

Is a real world event too telling?

OK, here's a last-ditch effort to avoid reason or logic, the two things which have to have failed. When you hit the back of your hand on a solid rock, do you say, "Oh good, I should do that more." Anyone who said yes can do the heavy lifting. Everyone else can do the thinking. You can't change your answer because you were 'trolling' this was a one shot.
