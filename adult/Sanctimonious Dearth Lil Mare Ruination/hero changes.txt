1. the hero has a tactile fetish for reasons, he likes ot touch their faces
2. the women are supposed to be more natural so they should get tired and injured (issues getting this right, how tired should they be if the goddess can resurrect them? Answer: They die. They come back. The hero's confused.)

3. add their names (he'll forget. Do it anyways)

4. the hero is 'stupid'


5. the women should have more powerful orgasms, and describe them more often (it might be already enough, I need to reread it all anyways)

6. Describe just how long they're having sex?

rationalization (as a justification for doing something, and/or to make himself feel better)
cyclical reasoning
circular reasoning

causes may be logic dysfunctional
neuroticism
psychosis


and social dysfunctional
narcissism
sociopathy

and not literal psychopathy, because the hero wouldn't have the need to rationalize anything he ever does at that point
