There are some pretty obvious limitations to what can be done in the bunny game.

Even if the main character were a male and he was dating.

Since the player character's a bunny in the first game. All he really has to do is become aware of the existence of laws and magic in order to use them.

Even though the outline says existing without making a decision the story itself gives full control to the bunny.

If this is an ARG then I have a high level girlfriend.
