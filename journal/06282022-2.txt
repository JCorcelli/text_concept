There is only one muscle that I can't relax while breathing in,  keeping the tongue on the roof of the mouth. And while I'm paying attention it's important to relax even deeper while breathing out.

Back on my regular 3500 mg of potassium I see the intense pain already went away. I think I have a performance boost while exercising. It becomes painful when my aerobic muscle weakens but I'm not yelling from how intense it is.

I am surprised how effective potassium has been at altering my body. I have to face the fact this is something that's going to weigh on the public consciousness too heavily to tell them right to their face. I like the idea of including potassium in any sugary food or food with sugar addative but obviously it will cause severe pain in high doses. This is not something I can dictate, everyone's experience will be different, maybe it isn't worth it.
