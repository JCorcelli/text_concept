I can simplify this.


I had to lose weight, ingest more potassium, get my heartrate down below 70 bpm, and practice flexing my upper core muscles. Finally, after eight months, I can sit straight by flexing my core muscles.

I don't feel like killing anyone.

I am pretty medium in mood.

What am I going to do?
