I think people are obsessing over automation.

I am obsessing over the pain in my shoulder.

For good reason.

I'm going to lean into the notion that Twitter's more like a game. The stuff I say on there hasn't blown up out of proportion.

I believe people treat all social media like a game, but the response to that was every damn thing I wrote in the buttcrack of the internet, and everything anyone ever said about me personally became a hacker's wet dream.

I remember what I've said. And in remembering, the way things work for me won't be the same for many other people. There's no point to try explaining a strange game I'm not getting instant feedback from. Even ten seconds could be too much.

It seems like I could improve my body way waaay the fuck more than I've even managed to. It takes time and the right diet. I thought increasing potassium would have had a drawback but that only lasted a day or two, thirst at night mostly, now I just want to try more.

So this is the diet-evolution paradox we're in. Our dopamine responds to sugar like any other addictive substance. As far as I can tell it doesn't respond to potassium. Because evolution is random, our bodies demanded potassium by craving sugar. Correlation does not mean causality, evolution doesn't care, any strong correlation is enough to give rise to a natural desire.



Eastern-cultures are paid to think, Americans are paid not to. And the more I think of it, the truer it is. I think therefore fuck Capitalism.
