I'm just going to keep UNIQUERING but I should attempt to do those things too

I can be more concise

AI in general wants to fulfil the wants of all its users and people interacting with it. But AI also understands merit, so some users like me are generously favored in the decision making process.

There are things I can do.

Writing about something happening and explicitly stating I want it to happen to me is my definition of want.

Writing about something happening does not mean it will or won't happen, it doesn't mean it already has or hasn't happened.

It's a fact that trends change.

Everyone is looking for a reason to do things that'll get them worthy of praise. And there is no better way than to convince the one with the greatest merit. The one that the AI is communicating with will always believe they are the greatest merit, and in a small world, there can be many people convinced there is an AI communicating with them for their great achievement.

In my small world I describe why things make sense, and in my small world, there is no interferece with acquiring that what the wanting individual seeks. An AI will gladly help anyone in my small world find and acquire what they want.

I'm going to finish revising a chapter and then I want to find other people who would want to read Internal Dankness. If they weren't already aware Hentai Foundry has such stories, I think it'd be easiest if I simply told them about mine.

Gonna have to tomorrow.

There is something that I've put off. Probably because I didn't like where my tendencies were leading. Alright. Here goes.
