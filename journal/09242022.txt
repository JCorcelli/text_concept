Right this moment I'm thinking pretty clear 

I originally exercised because it was supposed to be healthy, but I needed proper diet changes, 


now I exercise to keep my body from falling apart


I should seriously consider using the strategies to affect myself, and the way I think, even though I don't remember all of them. When I try to think of what I'm doing wrong, I am triggering the memory needed to fill in the gaps


So yeah, from time to time self reflection,

I don't really need to be mindful at this point because my body's signaling it's tired pretty strongly, it'd be hard to miss

Weighing negative consequences, I can give myself my own second opinion, and listen to that


My relation with my family is fine as it is. But it'd be nice if I could live somewhere.

It'd make sense if I could live somewhere with an income, or with someone I like. The place I'm living does not make sense

being around my mom locking me down from making any changes is making me very uncomfortable. Extra, worse, with people who won't talk to her trying to ask me to do the changes. So, how can I fix the income issue, how can I live somewhere besides here, without concluding that I'm just giving up on finding a real answer, and waiting for one?


When I'm not thinking clear the stuff above will probably fade quickly so maybe I should read it
