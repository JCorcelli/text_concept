There's a culture that gives their kids two names. Their birth name, and their spirit name.

The birth name is as it sounds, it's what their parents would call them before they really got to know who they are.

The spirit name is a coming of age of sorts. When the personality of a given person is revealed, the name they are given represents the flaw they will struggle with for the rest of their life. It serves as a reminder that an impatient child should be called "patience" or a crude man be called "virtue" or a gluttonous be called "full" because when a culture genuinely believes their adults behave to match a stereotype the spirit name will round their personality enough their worst traits don't overwhelm.

And here in my household if my mom thinks I have a trait she doesn't like she constantly changes my spirit name and calls me whatever that is. I'm pretty sure I told her not to do that when I was four or five. So the purpose of a spirit name to some people is just to be annoying.

A spirit name's not something you'd change so often on a whim because the person hearing it is supposed to know it's meant for them. I guess I'd call my mom "respectful" in the same vain she'd call me "clean" because she's some kind of clean freak most of the time, but another word might be "active" because I don't clean due to laziness.
