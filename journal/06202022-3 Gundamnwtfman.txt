why would someone do something to reduce their chance of survival?

Many a reference I've found online is altruism. Someone sacrifices themself for the greater good in those rare glory-driven moments.

This isn't what I was thinking.

I was leaning more towards why people ruin their chance of procreation. Doing elaborate death-defying stunts. Why the past experts endanger the environment for gains. I can't answer that.

Hypothetically, they were required to.

Metaphorically, society holds a gun to their head. The gunman will stand there for eternity. Lose virtue by pleading for life, running, or trying to fight him. Beg for death and he twirls the gun and cocks it, "Beg some more," the same threat just a bit edgier.

I'm past this. All metaphysical obstacles, my chances of procreation and survival are just a game now. The same threat persists. The metaphor persists. I destroyed giants, wild beasts, tamed monsters, crossed the ocean, and built cities. The gunman stands there, trained on me. 

"Why, the, fuck are you still standing there, bitch?" I ask him.

He tells me, "This is my only life."

Then he leans closer.

He tells me, "I can point the gun at someone else if you like."
