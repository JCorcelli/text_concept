After referencing what I said in the past. Without school, there's actually absolutely no fucking thing that could have ever been said about me, and with school the stupidest shit could be on record without me ever interacting with a single human being, and the people who harassed me while I was there can pretend to be victims while they go around shooting the place up. I'd like it if none of this happened, but it's too late.
