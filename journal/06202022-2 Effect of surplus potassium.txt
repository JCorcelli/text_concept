I'm not sure if I understand why, but doubling the amount of potassium I'm consuming has coincided with a drastic increase in healing, I look more muscular, I woke up at a pretty decent time, and I'm falling asleep without the slightest issue. I know all the reasons I've said before, but if that was all, I'd have fixed everything already. 

Side-effects like thirst and pain, pretty negligible considering they only lasted a week or two. They are only noteworthy for a couple of hours each day.

I predict that after completely healing, I have to cut the amount of potassium in half, and only increase after exercise or other physical injury.

It's amazing, in today's society million dollar athletes aren't guaranteed to heal from an injury, and it might just be a case of potassium deficit, of course, I'd suggest that at this point. Ok, unlike many athletes, I'm not physically built, I'm not enormous, maybe their needs for recovery are beyond my own. But there are many cases where people gain seemingly miraculous god-like powers from injuries, however rare, and it may be because they ate right.
