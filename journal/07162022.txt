I'm still having aggravated thoughts but at the moment with my health improved they seem to be manageable.

The thing that seems to be really preventing me from keeping calm is a completely reliable circulation. At the same time, I've heard that can make it difficult to get out of bed in the morning, makes people want to sleep in.

So do I work faster or slower if I abstain? Or does my demand for quality change canceling out any gains?

For some reason my penis feels sore. Maybe I shouldn't play with it for a while. It's going through some healing too.
