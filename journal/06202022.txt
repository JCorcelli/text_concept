It's pretty obvious what I want. I know everyone is doing what they can to make it happen for real.

Having the power to reshape reality to whatever I want, there's a distinction from that and from any other.

Conversely, I'm protected from external influence. There are only certain things that I'm made aware of I need to defend myself from.

Directly challenging myself doesn't guarantee change. Thinking I can't change, and saying I can't change, but wanting to, suddenly I have.

(Hang on I need to see if this has any effect on brain training or if it's a selective memory thing)

A more drawn out explanation.

External goals are obtainable by wanting them, as long as it's a possible outcome.

Internal goals. In order to change myself, I have to want something and present myself with the futility and consequences that accompllishing it implies. And it's not even necessary to try to change. Getting a little external feedback by presenting a mock version of reality is good enough, it doesn't matter if I honestly believe it.

Continuity. Wanting something and accomplishing it doesn't change how much I want it. Nor does wanting something and it already being true have any effect whatsoever. I suppose there are mechanisms which make someone tired, or less interested, but they don't last forever, the desire soon returns.
