Schedule

screw full body exercise! I'm going to try to be optimal.
Every day I'm going to work out walk and do crunches
Every day I'm going to jerk off do full-body warm ups with light med-rep crunches
Every day I'll do something more fun than just weight lifting

mon leg, speed, squats
tue arms, pushup, bicep
wed leg, jog, jog
thu arms, tricep, deltoid
fri leg, speed, squats...
sat arms
