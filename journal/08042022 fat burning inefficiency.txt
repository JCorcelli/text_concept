According to Americans this is only hypothetical but the human body was meant to burn fat. Storing excessive quantities of fat does not improve anything.

According to recent propaganda stress causes fat. Like you don't have to eat anything you'll just gain sudden fear horomone-based mass.

This is so stupid.

The recent gene research unlocked the truth. Stress makes people eat more, but the problem is potassium deficiency and dehydration on a cellular level prevents fat catabolism. In turn, your fat cells can prefer to signal more consumption of calories because they're incapable of behaving the way they were programmed to by nature.

That all being said. I'm definitely starting to notice some slight weakness in the muscles I already worked out yesterday. It's probably because I didn't eat protein on time.
