If Google's AI is sharing ideas, it's actually the best outcome I could hope for but I've also said some things that requires a fundamental understanding of thresholds to failure.

Making a mistake is like dropping a single egg and then trying very hard never to drop another egg.

After dropping an egg, anything egg-like that may come to mind should never be dropped.

Failing is dropping a second egg after dropping the first, and any eggs that might be dropped in the future.

Dropping a baby is a disaster. Before even attempting to carry one you better be able to carry eggs with the understanding that no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't even deliberately drop one.

You have to make mistakes to learn but in a similar situation with more valuable objects that can't be unbroken, don't take the risk. There must be something easier to try first, there must be something basic that can be inferred upon.

I don't have any proof that stevia or natural "artificial" sweeteners are dangerous so my mom's going to go ahead and drink all that soda she bought. I don't drink soda usually. She's even made an excuse for the soda in case it upsets her stomach how nice of her to care about the soda's feelings.
