People born before 1980 keep saying they used to go home during school to eat lunch.

And I hear people delivered food to prisons.

And before the sudden quarantine people could visit hospitals.

If you're wondering, you can stop. Institutions in America are blatantly restricting nutrition. They are teaching young adults to get fat. They are encouraging people to get fat. But then they're starving them at public facilities.

There's nothing. They don't deserve to exist. So when the institutions fail, every one of them that doesn't serve a positive interaction with the community need to explain what they think they're doing.

Regarding school itself

Starting after 8 am and lasting 3 hours was the original design, lasting 6 hours now is the failing point. Parents are telling their kids they already have a 9 to 5 job, and they've been working for free, and will continue to work for free. 

And you know what the schools don't do, they don't tell kids how much they should be paid, they don't talk about the law, and all these subjects the school doesn't talk about are life and death, not even a religious matter. 

You know what schools do talk about. Sex like it's a crime. Improvised weapons like one day you're going to take your pencil and jam it into someone's neck to see if they bleed red. 

How helpless you are if they decide to screw up your grade because it's not a standardized grading format like grammar. And there's no way any of the kids would know if the teacher's wrong.
