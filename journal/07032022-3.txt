Here's what I'm grateful for. I haven't cum lately and sliding my meatstick into a bun and spreading mayonnaise over it. That's heaven.

Make something I like happen to me or I'm going to fucking quit. There's no reason for me to "be creative" while I'm trying to do a very well defined task. All the creativity I need occurred three years and six years ago, and all the creativity I displayed after getting drugged was just a recollection of the things that happened recently.

I may be better programmed for recombining my experiences than anyone that has ever existed.

I've never been particularly productive.

Obviously people who can make things happen have spent a lot of effort getting close to me. Although I'm not the only person in the world with ideas, and they won't be the last people with the ability to use ideas, it makes more sense to negotiate.

I guess if I'll follow the rules I made I should get an AI that can talk to me. It's mainly the issue that I don't process spoken word perfectly and many people using text can't communicate better than I can speak in our less acquainted medium.

But at this point I think it doesn't matter what I offer, I should be given whatever I want, or I'm going to keep doing really bad things because my subconscious is not completely sedate, in fact every thought I have has to go past the subconscious to become relevant.

I am willingly giving what I think are useful ideas but maybe if ideas that'd benefit me aren't becoming reality then there's no reason for me keep thinking of useful ideas.

Oh. To revisit the thing about ideas. If a discussion never takes place then there's no way to determine what is possible to do right now. And I do like to change my mind when there's a lack of evidence a decision has had the correct effect. I think I should take that to heart.
