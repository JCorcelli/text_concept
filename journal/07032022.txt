I know my life sounds interesting to other people because with all this talk about how sacred it is and how you should never give up, my family sound like lunatics, how the hell would any of you live if your family was trying to prevent that through their general behavior while denying it a few seconds later?

And because of that, before I had ever even suggested that I was creative or good at having ideas, people were looking to me for great ideas. References to things that exist may be creativity, but that is the essence of not having a new idea.

So when you believe you have a use for a more calculated, less random, speculative, you really need to tell the person you're looking for ideas from ie me. I am pretty sure that if it's unclear whether what I want would clash with another person's idea of a happy future, I'd be able to find a way to work around it so more than one person gets the way of life they prefer.
