This is a pointless, what if?

Just look at me.

Do I look like in a naturally occurring ecosystem, or an economy that pays people fairly, I'd be an unemployed 36 year old virgin who can program.

And the people who find jobs programming, can't program. Or they at least pretend they can't.

?

I'm not a negative bunny.
I'm an anon bunny.
I'm not an anon bunny.
I'm a golden bunny.
