Time is not a currency

Time is what people have to pay for, when it's someone else's time

Time that can be spent accomplishing or doing nothing at all is what worthless currency is given away freely for

The value of currency is almost nothing because people don't do anything with their time but make the promise that it has value

But honestly if I could be paid in time it'd actually have a meaning

As things are time is non-transferrable 


I know people say not to keep score but NFT and cryptocurrency does nothing but keep score so 

if I am accomplishing with my time and they are not then I deserve bare minimum their best days of their life that they spend accomplishing nothing

Recreational sex doesn't really do or accomplish anything, women should be preapared to have children

Christian sex is genocide
