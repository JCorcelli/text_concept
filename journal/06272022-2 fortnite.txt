How's this. Teach a monkey to use text to voice with neuropod.

Meaning, teach it to read, write, and communicate. Then have it play Fortnite.

If you can teach a monkey to behave and earn money. Money is worthless. But at the same time, you have the technology to teach anyone anything.

Am I being an asshole because I don't think Pong is impressive enough?

If you can legitimately teach an animal through neural stimulation, then old age won't prevent someone from learning. Or more importantly, it can be used to delay age-symptoms, there's still too much I can't predict.

I'd imagine people are more interested in seeing super-intelligent animals than old people though.
