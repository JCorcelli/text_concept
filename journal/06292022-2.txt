wtf I'm the french flag? And talking to the same gender in France is apparently a waste of time.

As a kid, I wanted to screw girls my age about as much as an adult woman. But, I stopped myself, it's not worth the hassle. So why do other people think it's ok? Even though law enforcers are going through efforts to make it very not ok.

Saruei's the only connection to France I'm aware of but the news their economy will improve soon sounds good. Have I done anything that affected France besides Saruei?

Ok. Besides using the word renaissance?

Uh. Besides referring to French as the American slang for "doing something in a completely screwed up way because it's better than normal?"

Besides all these things I don't know. I thought there was something porn related when I said porn was important but I think that inevitably lead to Saruei in VShojo. Am I missing anything?
