I must try something different.

I'll use the coping mechanisms I used when I was a baby.

Certainly, a grown ass adult can imitate a baby.

Things are much worse if people pay attention to me, just shut up and pretend.

A lady would not show me her butthole as a gesture of common courtesy. She definitely wouldn't ask the moment I pique her interest in any way.

I asked why people would do stuff that actually works against them a while back. The answer was to virtue signal, but really, if the conclusion is absolute destruction you'd be better off getting away from whatever group is calling for something damaging.
