USA birth rate has been below min sustainable levels for ~50 years which means 

population increase is from importing workers.

Our education system doesn't sustain our education.

People are too unhealthy to do manual labor so... manual labor goes to the first person willing to do it.

Our education system doesn't sustain our health.

The housing market is in a crisis.

Our education system doesn't sustain our shelter.

Algorithms to tell us when it's alright to have sex with a hot single in our local area, and they actually work well enough to keep in business.

Our education system doesn't sustain our needs at all.

If what I've been saying for a couple days isn't obvious USA should keep open because doing otherwise is pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. And although I'm quite disenchanted by how every problem I've had when addressed by other people has made it worse, it's not like I want to kill every single one of them after mercilessly torturing them in the same way I've been treated.

Now I'm starting to get the nuances of my spine again. I can align it so my blood's not pooling in one corner of my face. With the pain decreasing I can feel my chest rubbing against my shirt and the muscles from the weightlifting two days ago are still sore enough I feel them burning slightly.

If I abstain for one more day my next orgasm should be one of the best I've had. At the same time, I said I'd do full body exercise. Uh oh. Priorities...

Ok. I will follow the exercise schedule from my glorious basement dwelling.
