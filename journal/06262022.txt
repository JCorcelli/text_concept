It's a new morning and "French press coffee" just makes me think Saruei is extra horny.

I can acknowledge that Twitch was created because of a suggestion.

Thanks for creating an internet foundation altering history just to potentially represent my greatest concerns being addressed.

People do really crazy stunts to get attention. If my writing is controversial simply because I haven't gained attraction, and not for some other reason, then so be it.

The thing I keep bringing up is for society to work, there must be an intent to make it work. The same principle for a video game. The computer can cheat, but if your goal was to keep the player alive then the computer can pretty much guarantee that's how the game will play. As long as the player doesn't actively seek a way to die, the game itself can respond, and change to prevent an accident. That's basically the way people would prefer things happen in real life, whether they're in dire need or if they're providing support. 

There's no need to create adversity, my mom's a genuine threat to society. Look to her to discover how a self-righteous nihilist can join a Christian church and kill her family with words, starvation, beginning vendettas, slandering the government, and negligent abuse without outright abandoning them. Because like her, parents who mistreat their own kids are the source of perceived evil. You could go to war with another country, then there'd be real adversity, why fake it?

Thanks for the money, mom.
