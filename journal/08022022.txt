All did was drink a little extra water with salt and some honey and today it feels like I'm urinating constantly at the tip of my penis fuck! Ok not just the tip.

Fuck. It's just the sensation's changing. Fuck. FUck! It's not bad, but like I said, kind of like something passing through my urethra like I should be at the toilet so my attention's going there.

I won't be surprised if I cum in the middle of sleeping tonight.


I continue my fasting diet which may just be slightly under 200 kcal per day if it's not going over at all. I'm only just beginning to feel pangs, but not really hunger. And the drowsieness I had is much less now.

The experience of eating very little is almost non-impactful as a complete grown-up. The younger I was the more extreme my emotional and physical weakness became as soon as the time of day I should eat came around. Of course I don't know what I ate then, I just know it got to the point I was willing to annoy my mom and look pathetic for hours on end with zero return and she would pretend we got plenty to eat until later then she started outright blaming dad.

Children simply need more, all the time, and being forced to go for walks while being underfed in proportion I think I got severely fucked over. Even worse than I imagined.
