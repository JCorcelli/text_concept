It was unofficial but I feel like I have to abstain as long as 

1. A woman doesn't have sex with me
2. Women can't abort
3. Things don't get worse
	For me
	For living things
	For the planet

I do consider this an extremely discomforting sacrifice.

Even if a woman has sex with me I won't deliberately masturbate, but I might need to recover from the change.

It actually gets harder to become aroused which is immasculating, if I don't play with it, but for now I think I'd better not risk.

My health is good enough I can take about three women per day when they want it. I will continue to struggle to recover to adequate shape I only make a little improvement. I think it's mostly my shoulder muscles, at this point. I'm not sure if there's a better way besides physical therapy. Second best is exercise.
