I need to be realistic.

Sure, I'm a technomancer. That is an undeniable fact right now.

I am physically fit in kind of a imperfect way, still improving.

And finally, Google saw just how far they had to go to get me to see Elon Musk.

People may be using my ideas, and if I post in the right place the technomancy is a little too thick. But they don't know me.

Even after I argued the system of personal development is completely cracked, the conclusion was to steal, not ask, not beg, you, I, have to steal whatever social interaction we can.

The vampire references have been innocuous. But Twilight depicted me as the main characer at the lockers. So, that's been set up, acting like a vampire is somehow the way to steal what I want.

Currently I'm very good at writing whoever I want into an arbitrary plotline, so all I need to do is get some consent to use their real name, description, whatever between now and publishing.

I'm just about done with this shit.

I need to focus on... cholesterol reduction.

Peanut butter is healthy but I don't feel healthy so what the fuck.

Let Jordan Peele feel a little lonely.
