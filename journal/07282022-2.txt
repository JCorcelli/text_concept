The VShojo Girls are being told to respond to things I'm doing. They're being provided content from "supporters" who would construct a narrative that's not in their favor.

The evidence so far has left me with complete certainty, they're being told to say things.

so why are the people providing them dangerous content allowed to stay hidden and try to create a narrative around these women?
