woke up with an erection, how motivational

It looks like I can still lose 40 lbs. I'm just that bloated or something. I don't think I could have much more than that.

Here's what matters. I gained the ability to focus before I was hospitalized. It happened when I was preteen. More like, it happened when I was still younger than ten. When I had enough autonomy to play video games despite my parents limiting my time to an hour per day. Nothing they did improved anything.
