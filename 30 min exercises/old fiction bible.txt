In religious verses there are a lot of answers to questions people repeat a lot. Let's give this a go.

Characters: 
the narrator - someone you believe, a really well known dead person
the author - anonymous
god - the reader
# - the verse. "1."
God - the initial question, outrage, or sarcastic comment a person may have.
Us - my interpretation of the verse

1. 
God. Why does all this exist?
Us. You, silly. (you're 0-18 years old)

2. 
God. It doesn't make sense.
Us. Try not to think about it all at once, because it'll never make sense.

3. 
God. Why is there light?
Us. You wanted something, and you got it.

4. 
God. Why is there discrimination? Why don't people always get along?
Us. It's nature, you saw light couldn't exist in darkness. [note: unlearn this behavior]

5.
God. Why are there labels for so many pointless things?
Us. These are just words. Without them we're wasting our talents. 

6 - 23 You'll be quizzed on this later. Each day represents how long you should spend to memorize everything.

24.
God. Can meat spontaneously generate flies?
Us. Living things make living things in their own image. No. 

25. 
God. I created all living things, why can't I make more?
Us. When you can write a book, you can make up whatever you like. But I'm guessing if this was difficult to understand it's a little advanced.

26.
God. Why do I suddenly give this "Us" character the right to make decisions?
Us. Deep down you really want someone else to tell you want to do, so you feel like you aren't being blamed.

27. 
Anon. "No. I'm not god if I have to harm animals."

Us. "It was just a joke. We'll find someone smarter to be god."
