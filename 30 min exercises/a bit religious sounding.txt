Weak people can't be at peace, and they're weak because they have nothing to believe, they're weak because they're dying out of hunger, so much sugar they'll kill for an ounce of meat, and they'll survive better in prison, bored and well fed, than the welfare system provides.  A starving body is bad, a knowledge of how to do evil is only safe in the hands of those strong enough to stop it.
