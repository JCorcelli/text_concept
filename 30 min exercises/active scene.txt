I think this is a bit advanced.

I'm thinking of some audience psychology while writing. I was working on ways to present the setting. 

"There's a lopsided tree with a large branch. There's a sky. The moon is out."

This scene is passive. I know the audience can use it, but why would they?  I granted nothing and now they expect nothing. 

"The branch falls off the tree with a whipping crack, making a dull thud no less than a second after."

Now it's been used. Wish granted?

A wish is very specific, as of this moment anyone can say or write to fulfill their own wish. 'Don't make the branch fall' is a negation, and I'll have to rewind for this next part...

Restructuring this scene so the branch is more meaningful.

"Squirrels are playing on one thick branch of a lopsided tree under a moonlit sky."

Multiple things are happening at once. I set the scene and used it, the animals are important to a wide audience, wish fulfilled.

Wish fulfillment is part of media. It is almost ubiquitous for a new audience that expects nothing.  It can be done for a targeted audience. 

Games can potentially fulfil more than one wish, it is designed to accept imput.

The hypothetical 'VR environment' sandbox is a wish granter. Wishing you were in a place can be said to be 'in VR'.

Designing a game simulating VR may be accomplished by writing with a very elastic plot. Many choices that you can undo. Without challenge, story games are like that.
