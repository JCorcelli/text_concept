Social justice is a means for the populace to prevent people of wealth or influence from getting away with injustice.

The image being spun has made social justice activists look like they're the wealthy bastards who need escalating traumatic blows to their skull because they are sending hate mobs to penniless 30 year old virgins' homes.

The rich people who may or may not deserve to be pressed for enabling this money grubbing hatemongering are spinning that they're normal, they just pay the manager and he/she fucked up.

So what you say ends up being botted... but if I can say good things about someone and they're assaulted by a hate mob then it's not worth doing anything but killing hate mobs. If the hate mobs are the ones committing all the crimes. Then you're better off having the hate mobs kill the hate mobs.

And it's so obvious, the people who benefit from paying social justice warriors, and creating shitty bots, and having hate mobs fight eachother instead of what they're supposed to do, are the assholes getting away with injustice in the first place.

So yeah, people who spend a lot of time protesting, and this, the rich people hiding from justice, they're working together. Always have been. Haven't ever done anything for me. Don't talk about them. Don't advertise for them. Or you are the problem.

Someone will come to your house to control your life. And you're never going to have a single thought that wasn't curated by a wife or a husband you hate, but you love to fuck so much.
