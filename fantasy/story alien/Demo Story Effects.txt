He patiently waits, up to 10 seconds, he gets tired looking by the second.

///// SKIT1: THE ALIEN RAN OUT OF PATIENCE /////

"Record log. I broke my navigator somehow. Now I'm stuck here alone in a dark cave.
I'm not sure how long it will be before I can find my way out, and I think my only option is to repair the navigator.
The journey is almost certain to be treacherous. The challenges ahead remain yet unknown. I do not need food or water because of my subdermal implants. I can only pray those still work at this rate.
Without technology to guide my hands and feet, I must rely on my own ingenuity and cunning. All alone.


Naaaviigaatooor.

NOOOOO!
NOOOOOOO!
NOOOOOOOOOO!
WHY!!!!!!!!!!!CH CH K NIAAH
UHHoooo Uhoo Mmmmmnnnhya. Mnnanak
Navigator... I can't.. fix it. I can't live without you."
THE ALIEN DIES

///// SKIT2: THE ALIEN RAN OUT OF PATIENCE BUT HAD A MOMENT OF HOPE/////

Navigator. You're alive - and functional!? Why didn't you say anything? Oh, nevermind that, that's not right. I wasn't thinking right. Tell me what to do. Give me directions and keep me motivated.

He patiently waits, up to 10 seconds, he gets more agitated by the second.

///// SKIT3: THE ALIEN RETAINED HOPE/////

It seems my navigator is not reliable. There must be... a loose wire. It's a malfunction or a connection problem. I'm getting lag. Yes.
...
Yes. No.
It's not my Co-pilot's fault. My dear, sweet companion.
I should have never opened my email at work.
It's time I make a stand!"

IN AN ATTEMPT TO SELF-NAVIGATE, THE ALIEN DIES WHEN HIS UNREALISTIC FEAR OF FREEDOM, UNRESTRICTED MOVEMENT CAUSES A PANIC ATTACK, KILLING HIM INSTANTANEOUSLY.
"hierk!"
DIES

////// AFTER CLICKING

Navigator, I'm glad you're with me or I wouldn't know the difference between my eye-wipers and my toe-fobbe."

There are strange things everywhere. I'd like to know my surroundings better, could you look around for me? You know my eyes are problematic. Thank you.

Encourage me, comfort me, tell me where to go. That's why your'e my co-pilot. Co. is for comfort, cooperation, and companionship.

You could give up. I'll ty to manage. I don't think I... are you still there?

///// SKIT 4: THE ALIEN DIED WHILE YOU WERE AWAY /////
IF SOMEONE EXITS THE GAME WHILE THE GIVE UP OPTION IS VISIBLE.
THE ALIEN IS CLEARLY DEAD WHEN YOU RELOAD THE GAME LATER. ON THE BIO LOG IT READS.

"No that's fine, that's fine just give up if you want. I'll tell you how things went when when you get back.
Please don't tell me you're really gone. I was joking, joking. Nav.. no Copilot. No..
Alright. I'll just... find something to do while I wait. I've discovered a strange, OH MY GOD!!!
!!bzrrrk!!hurk!!"
DIES


After a short walk

"You're such a good sport, navigator. 
I have a more positive outlook on life now.
Instead of giving up, how about we take a break once in a while? OK, that sounds much more relaxing."

///// SEVERAL SITUATIONS ARE ENCOUNTERED WHERE THE ALIEN MAY /////

////// DO SOMETHING POINTLESS
	LOOK AT STUFF THE ALIEN MAY COMMENT ABOUT
	1. SOLVE A 2D PUZZLE USING A 2D UI
	2. SOLVE A 3D PUZZLE USING A 2D UI
	3. TAKE A BREAK and survive by doing nothing until navigator returns

///// FALL
	Alien screams "NOOOOO!" Bangs into the ground below and cries. It loses 1 health and if it has 0 health it DIES.
////// BE ABDUCTED
	alien repeatedly yells: I come in peace
	girl: &#w*!@?3
	girl: ^!$% !@@@# ^&*($@@#
	[girl hits alien]
	[girl abducts alien]
	It loses 1 health and if it has 0 health it DIES.
	If the alien is alive you see him behaving like a doll for the girl.
////// ESCAPE
	"Mission accomplished" I hope you enjoyed that.
