Back before animals were used for shoes Humans needed to rely on their feet.  Despite the weak feet, the places they tread were potentially painful and dangerous to step.

This foot problem limited the area they'd travel to paths where they'd repeatedly trim and clean the way and softer sand. Despite having an inate desire for discovering  danger and edible food they weren't the best travelers.

Following herbivores is likely to reveal bounties of food, while eating them reveals nothing.
