My friend Buty (but.. why?) wanted some creative thoughts for a futuristic story where he could go anywhere without getting lost, but I don't feel like it. Please be creative in my stead. Sign click the poll to begin.

You look like you need help to get started.

Looks: Buty is a bunny. Buty has short fur. Buty has a long tail. Buty has stuffed ears. Buty is about average size.

Personality: Buty hates the smell of lavender. Buty responds to "why" and not "buddy." Buty likes to eat strange things, can't ignore advertisements and purchasing unhealthy food. Buty has mastered opening doors that swing one direction without help. Please use these details while thinking of a world Buty would enjoy.


(Buty doesn't know I'm asking. Buty can't get involved directly.)

I want to see if getting other people involved will change my impression of Buty at all. This will go wrong.
