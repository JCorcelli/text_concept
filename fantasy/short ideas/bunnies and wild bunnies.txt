Bunnies are domesticated, bred to be fluffy and extra cute like a stuffed animal. They live indoors and require pampering, doctors, and reassurance.

These bunnies look and act like pets!


Wild bunnies are natural, free, and clever enough to stay away from danger. They live outside and survive in dangerous exotic environments. They are sensible, or die from misbehavior.
