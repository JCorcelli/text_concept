Think about things you can do wtih flowers to suit artistic purpsoes.

Place them in bouquests. String th em around and wear them on your neck (a lei). Rather than the flower itself you can use the image and engrave solid objects. You can reproduce the shape with solid matter, a clay, or a metal.

The small can be extracted for a perfume. This can be placed on fabric, ventilated through buildings and landscapes.
