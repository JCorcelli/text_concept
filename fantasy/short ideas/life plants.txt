Inside us we imagine a life force. But if there lies a force within us why not the plants around us?

If something is so beneficial by nature then it stands to reason that if the plants run out, it would die.

Among them are plants that are sugary and delicious. They bear fruit which the animals enjoy, and devour wholly.

The seeds are dangerous enough that bugs don't dare eat.

The roots are hard like rope, but still delicious among many smaller animals.


Consumption of the fruit is said to restore one's vigour and strength for a short while. Dare you approach and taste the fruit?
