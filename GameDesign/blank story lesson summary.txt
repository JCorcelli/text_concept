MNEMONIC

Only sparing amounts of repetition

TEST / PRACTICE / EXPLORE / REFLECT

Depending on how well practiced someone is they may improve faster by

1 exploring, 2 practicing, 3 taking a test as a challenge, 4 simply trying to remember what they learned

REPEAT / REDUNDANCY

The point of redundancy is the thing you learn will influence how well you apply it in any future context
