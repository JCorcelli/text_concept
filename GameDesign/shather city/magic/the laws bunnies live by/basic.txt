This clarifies the first three laws all bunnies exist by, and does not necessarily cover their meaning to exhaustion.

rule #1 - attraction
You hop towards things you like. You hop away from things you don't.

What it means is being attracted to the things that interest and excite you the most is normal.

rule #2 - discover
Discover things and imagine.

This means, that despite the inherent danger of the unknown. Again and again, keep exploring. Keep imagining what it might be that is out there.

rule #3 - natural three
Ambiguity exists beyond the basics.

While rules one, two, and three are absolute, inflexible, and never erasable, the rest can be made up and additive to the original three.  Even the most definite rule can be broken if it is not among the first three.
