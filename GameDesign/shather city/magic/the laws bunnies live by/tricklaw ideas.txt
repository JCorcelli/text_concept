any trick that works on you works alike when you use it
if you get stuck at least one time you know enough never to get stuck again
a decision can take 0.0 seconds but something amazing is ...
when things stay in one spot a long time and then vanish, you need to look closer
the sound of tearing paper is AWESOME
