Basis

In this story you witness a helpless bunny. You try to guide it before its instincts allow it to survive, and then long after it refuses to listen.

There's a story that takes place over several days with limited time. 


The idea of the random element is to add replay of course.  The downside is it tells a different story every time.  The result may be the player replays until they get a result they like, and quit.
