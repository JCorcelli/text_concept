2 begin from acquaintance: work your way up. The stat can be visible on laptop.
3 personality is available today if you kissed her.
4 now you directly choose the options through dialogue, direct response behaviors.
	bunny stuff like scratch or jump on will be there too.  (These can be done, even if the options aren't there, but the response won't be unique)
5 you can choose to "improvise" and something in the room is suggested.
