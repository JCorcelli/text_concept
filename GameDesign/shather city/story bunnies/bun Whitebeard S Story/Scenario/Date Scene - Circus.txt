DATE (A>B mechanic)

BLIND
1:1 Obstacles
	1 Want to be with friend, make several phonecalls.  Phonecall is not interrupted unless bunny stops it.
		Actually meeting the friend, nominating this to envy.
		
	2 Try to escape through tunnel. Otherwise lose the date's interest.
		Solo, weirdo.
		
	3 Giving advice, like the date is just work. Interrupting friendly conversation.
2:2 Obstacles
	1 Talk about friend.
	2 Try to escape with friend.
	3 Force a fake rule.

With these hard obstacles in the way of a blind date, normal date behavior slips through the cracks.

ENVY
Friends just talk and change the subject to the other person. It gets real boring.

They can watch people.

GREED
Want to play game. Have to wait.

Want a prize. Have to play well.

Get closer to date. Have to talk.

GLUTTONY
Unfair. Orchestrate the event.
Spend a ton of money.
