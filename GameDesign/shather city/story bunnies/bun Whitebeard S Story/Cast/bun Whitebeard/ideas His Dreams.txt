The dreams bunneh have appear to be prophetic and testing. You can find out almost everything you need to know from his mind place.

When resting, bunneh can go into deep thought. (Pause screen)

When sleeping, bunneh will enter a dream state where he experiences things almost as real to him as reality itself.

DREAM STATE:
(only ideas)
In the dream state he:
(always)
saves.
recovers his body.
skips to the next day instead of waiting.

(sometimes)
knows about the bunny laws. He can change his laws if he only knew how.
can access precognitive knowledge in the form of maps, events that haven't occurred yet, places he should be, food he wants to eat.
can select his favorite food that exists in the real world, before eating a lot changes his mind.
can heal a heart.
will learn about his instincts.
has little adventures (mini games) that grant bonuses.
is tested for knowledge, and retaught anything he forgot.
