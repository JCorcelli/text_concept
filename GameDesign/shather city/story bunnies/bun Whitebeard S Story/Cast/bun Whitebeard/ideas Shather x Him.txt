(not the in-game "Events" per-se, but a collection of ideas)

DESCRIPTION:
See the city descriptions I've written AND From a bunny's point of view you see a lot more places to hide:

Anything taller than a foot could be squeezed under
Narrow places that aren't walled off could be squeezed through
Bushes, flowers, leaves, and fallen logs.
Bunnies see in 2D orthographic!?

The north is pretty homely, so you never see anything bigger than a horse-driven cart.

There's plenty of new smells, and lots of food, you can get lost easily out here.  This is a veritable jungle compared to indoors living.

Bunneh is cute, he can make friends with the humans easily.

EVENTS:
Scary animals (dogs, cats, raccoons)
Friendly animals (some odd looking, and bugs)
Grass
Veggies
Lots of humans find a bunny cute, they can be caring and pet him (and equally stupid and feed him sugar).
A strange 'black bunny' gang watches you, this is scary.
A new YOU with wild instinct (bunny you), you learn to dig and scavenge, if you survive.
