Cute_
Bunneh is so cute, he's going to make everyone he meets really happy.  They just can't stop looking at his adorable self.

Love_
Bunneh is powered by love. He has exceptional ability to stir up emotions with his antics. He learns to behave in order to make people respond. Especially his Big Kitteh.

Pop-ins_
There are secret lairs in the shadows of the house furniture. Bunneh learns about these because he spends so much time hanging around them.  He first meets the Pop-ins, a type of micro-bunny that exist in and around the fringes of a portal dimension.

Hidden_
Bunneh learns to sneak and remain hidden. He can use this at times when his cuteness would make him too cuddle worthy, and all he desires is to hop around.

Noms_
Food keeps him excited and full of life. It helps him think of easy goals to strive to, and seek out.

Happy_
With a little love and food he can't help but binky or sprint around with his ears uppy.
