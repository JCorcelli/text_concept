Bunneh is his nickname.

Every day he expects things to occur, like a sixth sense, he is usually right. He knows exactly what will happen.

In the morning he wants a snack.  He'll get a hug, a kiss, and a pet on the nose. Sometimes he gets that snack.

Between mornings and late afternoon is his time alone. He stands guard at a number of locations and watches his surroundings. Someone might approach him, and he'll demand to be pet. Occasionally he may be surprised, he looks for treats, and he gets tricked into more hugs.

In the evening it's play time. If he hasn't caused a mess already he gets a lot of hops in, and by the day's end, he evaluates how much fun he had, and maybe a few things he learned.

Late evenings and night he's hungry, so very hungry, and sleepy. He eats his hay to calm himself and he rests, occasionally lapping from his bowl of fresh water.
