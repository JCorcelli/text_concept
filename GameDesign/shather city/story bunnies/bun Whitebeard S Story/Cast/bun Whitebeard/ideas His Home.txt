DESCRIPTION:
The house he lives in is a Northeast style apartment building. Two buildings connected in the center housing two families each.

There are four nearly identical apartments, two with access to a backdoor, one with an attic. They all connect to a single basement with their own storage space.

They contain a single bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, walk-in closet and hallway, with slight variations in dimensions.

The backyard is a length of cut grass. In front of the yard are two porches.

The front yard has a gateless walkway.  There are small bushes in the front without any lawn and an overhanging roof.

A single parking lot with room for up to four cars is off to the side.
