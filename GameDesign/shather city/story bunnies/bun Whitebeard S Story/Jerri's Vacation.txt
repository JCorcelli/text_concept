Once a year Jerri and many other people in Shather have requisite vacation. They go out of their way to meet up with old friends and meet new people.  Married people are permitted to work half days, and general services are filled up with part-timers.


About Jerri's vacation days

Jerri lets bunny out all the time. Sometimes she even lets him out during the night intentionally. 

(See Weekdays for traditional routine)
Routine 1
	Day 1

	MID
	Jerri spends all day playing.

	NIGHT
	Jerri sleeps on the couch with Bunneh's cage open.

	Day 2

	LEAVING
	Jerri goes out to visit friends at a random point in the day.  She cages bunneh at that time.

	RETURNING
	Jerri returns home with a friend and they treat it like the weekend.


Routine 2 (Also applicable to weekends)
	Jerri has visitors in her home.  They can go long times without her saying their name, and they don't tend to introduce themselves to Bunneh.
	
	Visitor 1
	
	Jim
	Jerri has a visitor who calls her Kitty.  He acts overly familiar to her. He goes on the computer. He pets Bunneh until Bunneh gets annoyed.
	
	Visitor 2
	
	Cam.
	Jerri has a new visitor who smells like dogs and calls her Jr.  He is dressed very well.  He's always playing with the toys Jerri has and doesn't pay attention to Bunneh, which really riles him up.
	
	V 3
	Mitch
	This man smells like sour dough and confectionary sugar. He pets Bunneh in short spurts, which is nice, and he does it often.
