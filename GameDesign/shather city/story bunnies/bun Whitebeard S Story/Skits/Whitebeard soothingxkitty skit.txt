	soothing ability with Kitteh
	soothing ability with Big Kitteh
	soothing ability when Kitteh is with a friend
	
When Bunneh is alone with Kitteh his soothing aura calms her down.  She talks with bunneh when she's lonely and she's not so lonely anymore.

When Bunneh is with pet friends like Big Kitteh they are attracted to his irresistable charms and pet him and hug him. That's annoying so Bunneh is really good at avoiding them.

Sometimes Ms. Kitty brings over a friend.  The friend isn't always good for petting because they feel they are rude ignoring Kitty.  When they snuggle with Kitteh somewhere Bunneh can snuggle with them too and they fall straight asleep.  This gives bunneh time for mischief, right there in the room, or he can go somewhere else for fun.
