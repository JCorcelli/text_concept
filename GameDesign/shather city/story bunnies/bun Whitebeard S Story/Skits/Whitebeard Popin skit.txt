FIRST NIGHT (used in 2.2, NIGHT)
They don't talk but they have a curious look about them.  They periscope around and lean against things, as though they seek to push through solid matter. 

They keep their distance, respectful of Bunneh.

After a short while the small, dark blue bunnies begin to observe parts of the room until they go back into their light leaving bunny behind.

Bunny remembers the soul bunnies vividly in his thoughts.

GENERAL STORY
The bunnies develop portals. Random locations. They range from friendly animal habitats and coverage, to empty wilderness, foreshadowing.
