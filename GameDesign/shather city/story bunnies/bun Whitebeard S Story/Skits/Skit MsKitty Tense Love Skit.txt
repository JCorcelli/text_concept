what

I just had this impression. Right now.

Kit (look of disbelief): I know we've been doing this for a while now, why so sudden? 

Don't you feel it too?

(looking sideways, smiling politely) I don't.

(eyebrows tight) Why can't you try to see things from my point of view? I've seen your wings, and we're not seeing anyone else intimately. Or am I alone here?

silence

(getting closer, whispering) I just feel like it would work. You keep asking me to come over, now I'm asking for something that I think is reasonable.

Kit: no.

They sit around looking distracted for a while. Then Car has an emotional break, he distances himself physically and covers his head.
