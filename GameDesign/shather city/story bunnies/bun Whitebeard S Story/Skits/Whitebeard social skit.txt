[read the story again]

Jerri can be moody if you break rules.
	Rules, and shadow rules:
	1. Be in cage by bedtime. (1.2) 
		a. Be in cage by morning.
		b. Don't pee the floor.
	2. Don't be noisy.
		a. Using "let me out" At night
		b. Hopping to danger zones
		c. Hopping on furniture
	3. Stay out of kitchen
	4. No biting, damaging things. (2.1 bad bunny business)

Jerri would treat differently from obvious behavior change
	Eat
	Kiss Jerri back
	Goto cage on command
	Allow petting
	
Jerri will respond to needs
	No food/water left
	Trapped

Jerri will behave differently, disrupting the story
	Fall asleep while petting
	Structural alterations (shortcuts)
	Notable property damage (missing objects, chewed)
	
	Missing bunny
	Excessive billing (computer)

	ALL NIGHT KITTY
		the night cycle is broken
	
	EXCITEMENT
		pets and friends come over
		
		bunneh gets knocked back to his cage if things get really crazy. this loses a lot of opportunity.
