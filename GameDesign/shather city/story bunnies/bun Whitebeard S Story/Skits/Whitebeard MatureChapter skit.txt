The first house Bunneh grows up in is mysterious.

While he's resting there are cracking noises. Noises caused by wood pressing the walls, the walls breaking. It's very subtle, very quiet. Bunneh can hear it.

There's a lot of room between the walls because of the branches that can't be broken pressing them apart and holding the walls in place. There's a lot of open space between the walls and Bunneh enjoys moving between them and the central room with ease.

When Big Bunny isn't looking, Bunneh can go to his hidden spot and dig a cellar, it gives him more room to play in. This is only when Big Bunny doesn't know. She can always find out and fill the hole. She doesn't know what's down there, so it could be dangerous. Bunneh isn't afraid.
