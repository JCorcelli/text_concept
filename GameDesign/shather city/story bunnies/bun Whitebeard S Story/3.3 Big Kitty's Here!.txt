Vacation is over. Jerri has work.

The daily routine returns with Jerri gone most of the day.  She brings home various friends after evening.


MID (CHANGES)

A cat shows up. It climbs in the window.

It tries to pet, cuddle, kiss, and play with Bunneh. This turns Bunneh's liesurly every day activity into quite a challenge.

Its behavior is so particular and affectionate, it reminds him of Kitty. It rests on the bed... sometimes pretends to, on the floor. Bunneh starts to think of it as Big Kitty.

Oh that tail!

The glowing lights don't appear while Big Kitty is around. It tricks Bunneh into revealing himself. It makes strange noises which make him perk up his ears.

Bunneh has confused feels about this cat.

EVENING

Big Kitty is gone. Jerri comes home and does the usual.

NIGHT

Same as before.


? DAYS LATER

The cat is brought in by Jerri.  Bunneh lives happily ever after adventuring with intervention.
