Bunneh has a thought. It manifests as a bubble, like a soap bubble. Except it doesn't break when stretched. When it forms it stays apparent until [UI] it's noticed. He wants to do something different.

A number of objects in the room look very interesting and it's important he gets a closer look and spends time sniffing at them. This is very important bunny stuff, bunny science.

MORNING (5 am - 8 am)

Same as before and...

There's an opportunity to sniff about the bookshelf.  Bunneh eats books with new smells to gain knowledge. Because of that Bunneh can have magical dreams. 

The chairs sometimes look like a snack, even the carpet.

Chewing this stuff is bad bunny business.  He learned this already, he may consider wood a delectable snack, but it risks Jerri and makes her shout.

MID (9 am - 5 pm)

Bunneh rests. 

Thoughts of hopping around outside, dreams of adventures he's done before, imaginings of possibilities to come. All this happens in spirit.

The dreams are fun.

The bustling outside rings in his ears, so his dreams ring false.

He's alert and rested, not too eager to go out. This is safe, safe and cozy. A well worn cover on him and his bed, that's what his cage full of hay is.

EVE (6 pm - 10 pm)

Jerri is smiling when she enters the room, and she is talking to -

- someone this is always exciting. Bunneh knows Jerri but he gets extra treats from new friends. Sometimes they hold him, he doesn't understand why they end up holding him.  He can deal with a little holding for treats. 

- her friend. She wanted him over her house simply because it brings her joy.

"I will get dinner ready in a moment. This is Bunneh. Say hi." Jerri opens the cage Bunneh is in.

The extra figure [a new friend] does play with Bunneh.

A journal of the discussion between Jerri and her friend, as well as the interactions with Bunneh are recorded. It is possible to read the journal while Bunneh rests.

NIGHT

Same as before. Bunneh soundly sleeps.
