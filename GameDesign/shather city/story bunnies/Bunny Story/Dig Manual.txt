[digging burrows: solo]

The soft soil gives way and after just a day of effort bunnies have a place out of sight to rest. They can also cover it with grass and leaves to keep other animals out.

[digging caves: dangerously, solo]

Even thought this is not the best idea the bunny digs in without a partner. While digging you never know what can be found. But it's less rewarding without a buddy to help. Why bother?

A noise makes the bunny freeze out of fear. Without a buddy to potentially distract the cause, it can go on for a long time, the digging is less fun.

[digging caves: safely, buddy]

If the buddy is also a digger he will dig. But if not, bunny digs most of the way and stops to rest.  When there is a thump it stops digging and waits to listen.  If the buddy is ever missing something is a problem and bunny can wait for safety, when buddy returns. Bunnies trust their buddy.

[digging tunnels outside: buddy]

Sometimes there is a great spot to dig and dig at both ends. This is a tunnel and shortcut.

[digging inside: solo]

It's not very nice for the home owner but it's nice for the bunny.  Keep out of view?

The black bunnies formed a super-highway. This may come into play. Super.
