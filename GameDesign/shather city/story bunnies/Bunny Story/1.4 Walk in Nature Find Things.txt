Bunny spies a strange passage. In the passageway a couple of annoying squawky things sat. These must be what Boss called birds because they didn't touch the ground. Or maybe they're cats, some were in trees.

Bunny tries to hop through the narrow passageway. 

Along the single path are a bunch of green and blue flowers. They are tall enough they rise above bunny's head.

One of the birds spot bunny. It is too close so the bird makes a squawk.  All the birds join in and it is terrifying, bunny runs back, the noise is so upsetting he waits for it to fade.

A few more tries and bunny discovers going through the flowers, eating them is satisfying. So it does. When it finally stops eating it is on the other side separate of the squawky things. 

Oh neat, where is this place now? It thinks, creating the bubble of wonder.

The scenery changed. There aren't any bunnies in view. This is different.

It could go back now, back where the bunnies live. It's fun sometimes. Or it could go through more unknown. 

What if it runs into cat and bird? Eat grass? Find more wonder? The questions arise, it's exciting all the time!
