PARADISE UNLOCKED

Now go on and roam free.

BUNNY THOUGHTS UNLOCKED

It has its own thoughts. It enjoys these and shares them by revealing bubbles and all of these along with a list of hints collected by Boss appear with no explanation.

The bunny roams around the playground for as long as it likes. Nibbling the grass. Nibbling the flowers. Chewing on fallen branches.

There are places the bunny may go which aren't so fun. But with enough skill, or cuteness, it could find a way to emerge from the shell of innocence.
