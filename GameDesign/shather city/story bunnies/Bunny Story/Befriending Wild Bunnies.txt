BEFRIENDING A BUNNY
They show up out of the blue. Then if the bunnies meld they define the hierarchy and follow suit.

Bunnies tend to pair off but it's possible to have extra friends.

HIERARCHY
When entering, a bunny is unranked and everyone pets it, but after ## days it will establish rank.

It's simple, but bunnies are ordered by charisma. Bunnies with equal charisma don't fight.

HI INTERACTION
Each bunny answers to one other bunny. Except the leader and tied bunnies who behave and bond mutually.

In this system, you only see your second in command or your current selected buddy.
