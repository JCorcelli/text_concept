Remaining at home 4 days of the week Eclaire practices algorithms on the macrocorder (computer), her math studies pale in comparison.  She goes to school once per week to be tested and it is determined how far along she's developed her abilities.

For an hour each day her father invites her to come exercise with him. Sometimes she even requests an addition of another hour. The exercises are so fun and she's become flexible and graceful like a ballerina, also capable of feats of strength.  Her exercises are even becoming more acrobatic and engaging her train of thought to greater extents than some of her academic studies.

When she's not busy she's finding reasons to get busy. Her mother may have a few unfinished chores, and Eclaire will volunteer. She loves to help her mother cook. Sometimes she sees her father looking at her mother while she cooks.  There's something about it that makes her idolize her mother. Sometimes she sees Cooper around her mother while she's cooking, so she shoos cooper out of the house and shuts it.

She isn't tall enough to reach the adult tools yet.  For this reason she isn't allowed to enter the work studies.
