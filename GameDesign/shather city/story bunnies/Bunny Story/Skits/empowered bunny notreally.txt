some nonsense.
see that bunny.

it's hopping and skipping, binkying, so happy. it feels good. it is encouraged and rewarded, financially even. But that is not really empowering because it does not raise up all bunnies as a class.

wtf are you talking about?

*****
preaching?

There's a prophecy. There's a bunny. He on his way, he bringing 'The Truth' and our lies will taste dry like bitter ashes in our mouth.  Eat dirt with me now, so we may feel the redemption.
