	Find the hidden bunny game with Grumpies.
	
Eclaire finishes playing with the Grumpies and they're tired so they stand around.

Cooper informs them that bunnies are made of light, and so all but the border of their bodies becomes transparent making them difficult to see.

Eclaire and Jeref hide the bunnies including Cooper who remains awake.

When Trianna walks in she finds this to be amusing and starts gathering the Grumpies back together in a pile. Cooper may or may not remain idle. After a minute Trianna will give up if Cooper keeps hiding where she last looked.
