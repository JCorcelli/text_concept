	influence on grumpy
	drawing capacity
	disdain towards Cooper
	
Eclaire enables the Grumpies. She doesn't feign innocent while the Grumpies do a bad thing. She outright gives them powers, leeway, laws to favor, and she watches the Grumpies do a bad thing to defeat Cooper.

Eclaire is great at magic painting, thats her preferred method of interference. She'll spend a few minutes dotting up white paper, a teleporting spell or a barrier and she'll place it at the Grumpies' home base and then she'll give them the means of victory. The Grumpies take that power gladly, they start hoarding the food.

Cooper needs to eat, so he guards the food the best he can.  Eclaire just pretends he is a dummy. "Maybe if Cooper really wanted to make friends he'd make friends with the Grumpies." She'd think.


Name: Cooper (Light)

	use of bunny laws
	use of bunny lies

Cooper is an expert manipulator when it comes to the bunny laws. He really loves how bunnies made of light can exist and only stops liking it when Grumpies use it for evil.

The Grumpies go on the war path from time to time, at the beck and call of Eclaire. Sometimes they're armed with random items, sometimes they're organized by a Grumpy empowered with special causes.

Eventually they calm down of course. It seems like no matter the outcome of the small scale battles, this child Eclaire or her parents are willing to step in and feed everyone. It's just nice to be on top, so Cooper doesn't have to go one second without free roam, free hay, or free vegetables, even if he has to leave the house sometimes.
