This is the wilderness somewhere, deep in Lower Shather. The trees are all pastel green, blue, goldenrod, amber, crimson. No this isn't right, those things aren't normal.  That tree has a marble texture drawn on the bark. There's a rock that's been painted like an easter egg.  The grass is color-coded with long diverging lines.  This is impossible!

Then there's this bunny, it's a mess of all kinds of colors, and it's practically see through, who did this? Rosetta, "Hey, who are you calling a mess?"

Oh, you can hear me? "Of course. I can talk to you. I'm Rosetta. I'm just a figment of this distorted world. The whole forest will change."

With that Rosetta took up a blue paint can and sloshed it over a steep hill, it was a waterfall, and the ground below turned blue and filled until there was a pond below. 

It's literally a waterfall!

Rosetta started running the other direction and its blue oyster of paint it dragged cut a swathe out, drawing a lake bed above the waterfall. This isn't how nature works, it's all wrong.  

A big mountain sprouts up at the very end where Rosetta stop, a snow-covered peak forms within seconds.  Not really big, but compared to a bunny, pretty big.  The place is totally different, but no she's not done.

Rosetta starts to color the mountain strange ribbons of red and blue, and the water is painted purple, and the water is painted white? The land surrounding it is stained. The water runs clear at the waterfall, but then she comes back and colored it white!

Plants of these various colors appear around the land.  And now it's clear that where Rosetts hops, more plants are grown, faster, and slightly off-tone.  She eats the plants occasionally and takes a break or two before beginning a new excursion, coloring a new place, or changing one of her old paintings.
