there is a rumor that if you stand in one special place up on the hill, next to the benches, you will see the bunny who you're going to spend the rest of your life.

So you do, and out in the distance is a bunny. it is so special, and so magical a moment, you can't take your eyes off it. There's something unique and original about the bunny, something that makes you wish you were there with it.

When you finally look away there is a bunny sitting next to you.

B: Hi you're cute, you were staring at me. Are you going to propose now?
