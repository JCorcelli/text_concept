	How thief and stolen behave.

Jeffry is at his cemetery house because of an early work shift.  He gets up and puts on a hoodie, two ears perk up once it's on, then droop down past his shoulders.

He digs the graves here and he has work. A few hours later he takes a break.  He sits down on a dirty stool and eats a late breakfast to take the edge off.  He doesn't even wash his hands, but wipes them on a table cloth before picking up a pre-wrapped sandwich.

...


Out in town, there are dozens of colorful pink, red, white, and cute designer bunnies on display.  It's a show of some kind.

On shelves, the most well-kept bunnies sit stoically and make little perky ear movements at passers-by.

People in big coats snap pictures with their cell phones and text "How cute this bunny show is" to their colleagues at work, and other friends.  

There's a so-called prim breed of rabbit, the white coat.  They have absolutely perfect whiteness, and their ears come their out like big stalks of corn.  There are several of these white rabbits.  They're not getting so much attention now.

Someone walks over and quickly pouches one, he's got a pouch in his pants, a very large pocket. It's clearly a man with a very bright happy face but why is he doing that?  He grabs another white one and it disappears.  Soon all the white rabbits are taken and he pulls a hoodie over his short haired head. He looks like a rabbit, and he hops, he hops again, he's a rabbit? He jumps and seems to jump very far.

...

In a quaint town shack several bunnies are huddled.  They discuss the predicament, and their missing identical sister.  They plot.

...

In a luxurious wide mansion there are many servants, a man, and a white bunny.  The man talks to the bunny, the bunny remains stoic and still.
