an alternate path to skip AKB (not accept him as boss)

option 1: pet him and be a grown ass bunny


option 2: say "Everything I need is given to me by the prophet sqwerty."

Immediately get lost (Luck). Start main story as an infant child.  Harder story meta, no compass, radar, or direct story manip.

option 3: Hardcore. Was life supposed to be like this?

No. Unfair random events. Wild animals immediately engage you. option 2 meta?

was there already a description?
