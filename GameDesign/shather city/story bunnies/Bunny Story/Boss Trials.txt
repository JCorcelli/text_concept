These are issues that boss encounters. So it's called a trial.

LAW OBSESSION
The wild bunnies will sense the world change.  Their available actions change.  It's like they're being held back.

AGE
Older bunnies are less flexible. The actions change less. World stagnates, but the basic trials are more dangerous.

Basic Trials
Tier 1 - Fight Instinct
	Wild animals that harass the group disperse them.  They can be recollected later.
	
	Rain comes and bunnies go to shelter.
	
	Buddies fear new places, some stay back.  They will not enter a zone above their courage.
	
Tier 2 - Foreshadowing, Zone
	Changes in ambiance. 
	Food reduction.
	Sounds of wind, birds, rustling.  Restless bunnies.
	
Tier 3 - Dream Trial
	Old buns in particular.
	
	Remember their favorite days.
	
	Tutorials are relived, like you forgot something.
	
	Stories are shuffled, a boss will be very confused.  The shuffled stories return eventually.
	
STORY or LIE?
Older stories mutate, producing unwanted effects.  Untested stories can't be ignored, stereotypes, precautions.

Weird bunnies may be discriminated. The boss could lose their way, and stop being boss.

Random encounters, or idle chatter causes more mutations.


WEIRD MAGIC
From time to time there are bunnies and weird bunnies who use stories. They warp a truth in a world of future uncertainty. They create illusions. They're powerful and should be respected.

A wild bunny can befriend a weird bunny.  The weird bunny will never forget.


Human knowledge.  Angels.


ODD BUNNIES
Black bunnies live in magic tunnels.  Are they friendly?  A whole group can't go through a tunnel, this could be dangerous.

There's a bunny with a thumb.  It's a special kind of bunny.

Bunnies can come from paradise, the wild, and the sky.  Ask and they can share their story.
