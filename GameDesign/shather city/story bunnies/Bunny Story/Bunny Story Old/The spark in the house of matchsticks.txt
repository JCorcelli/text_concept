Light uses skills to move around the house freely. He also uses "light" to be invisible in plain sight which doubles his hiding skill when sneaking.

Racing around the house expands the skills Light has to include artful dodging and physical.  There are puzzles which expose the use of Light.  There are opportunities to lie to Grumpies to get certain outcomes and change their behavior.

The Grumpies are fed frequently. Light is not often fed directly, and treated like an afterthought.

When someone filles up Cooper's food pile and the Grumpies begin rummaging around in it, challenging them starts a contest.

Eclaire "No. This is for the Grumpies. You think you deserve this? Let's play a game. It is our game. You are just here to annoy us!"

[Eclaires Skit1]

Whenever Light loses Eclaire adds the law that Light can't eat from his container, and must eat outside. The mother Trianna feeds him by hand and pets him, consoles him, and immediately go to her husband.

Eventually Light wins. Eclaire "You cheated, so now you get nothing." She never plays the game again, but doesn't punish Light. Instead when he eats the Grumpies ignore him.

Eclaire begins playing a fairy tale story at night. She begins playing a clicker game of Grumpy ship. She begins distributing the paper magic to Grumpies without any particular goal in mind.

After this, Light understood Eclaire's feelings. He could almost see her say "I love you."

Light has one or more children on the way.

Eclaire pets Light sometimes.
