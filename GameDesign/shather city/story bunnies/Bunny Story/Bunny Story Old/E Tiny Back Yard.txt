Eoromwello goes outside and finds the wild bunny waiting there.

Taking a closer look allows them to transfer the spirit, but they can't touch physically through the gate. All of the knowledge from the spirit transfers back to the wild bunny and it continues its journey.


/// MORE BACK YARD STUFF

There are some berry bushes, eating the berries and various plants will let you know how things taste and smell. 

Pooping around the plants will make them grow back nearly instantly.

This gated region acts as a transition area in case the player wants to go back to Eoromwello.
