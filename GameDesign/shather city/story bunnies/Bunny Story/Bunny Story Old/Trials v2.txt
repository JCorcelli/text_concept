LAW OBSESSION
The wild bunny feels the world around it shift from this point on.

Tier 1 Instinct
	Wild animals start to harass the group forcing them into limited ranks. Until eventually it's just the one bunny and his buddy.
	
	Rain comes.
	
	Buddies run away when you explore places.
	
Tier 2 Foreshadowing
	The ambiance changes. Something in the environment reduces plentiful foods. The sounds of wilderness grow restless.
	
Tier 3 Deja-veus
	You dream you're back in paradise.
	
	You relive tutorials.
	
	Laws and stories randomize, confusing the bunny.

TEST THE STORIES
Stories mutate, producing effects. Even untested stories generate precaution and stereotypes a bunny can't ignore.

The bunny may stop listening to weird bunnies entirely if a stereotype goes uncontested in its mind.


LAWSMITHING
From time to time there are bunnies and weird bunnies who illustrate stories. They warp a truth into fractions that must be dealt with. They create illusions that change the way the game works.

WEIRD MAGIC

A wild bunny can sacrifice to feed a family.
Black bunnies with magic tunnels.
Human knowledge. Computers. Internet.

ODD BUNNIES
Odd bunnies are scattered around in some locations and they will follow you within the zone. The place they want to go is indicated.

There is one type of bunny with a thumb. Special bunny.

Instead of paradise or the wild, bunnies can also be birthed in the sky. They share the story, and contrast it to the ground.
