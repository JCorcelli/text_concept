Eoromwello has some things to say about the bunny locker.

"This is a place meant for fun. If it isn't fun just ignore it, OK? I have a lot to say about some things because they're really fun and silly. Don't take me too seriously, these things do ABSOLOUTELY NOTHING besides change how I look. It's the intent that matters."
