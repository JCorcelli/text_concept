The scenery starts out misty and unclear.

> Well.. then that's settled.

It's a person. The fluffy, bossy person hops away diagonally twice and glances back at you for [just a moment -0/ until you follow -1].

Once you progrss to the next area, you caught up.

> Hey. You aren't hopping right. You need to hop like me! / The fluff ball does a zigging jig around.

++You start to zig like him. Whether you want to or not.

You finally have a chance to roam around freely.

options {
There's an annoying bunny. To your immediate right is an engraved rock. Behind the bunny and all around you is tall grass.  There's a tree close enough you can see the bottom of its canopy above you.  There's a jungle beyond this.

 You think the annoying bunny has more to say.

Upon closer look the rock is very well made. Even closer look and... an apple. [ you ponder about apple]

The tall grass smells wonderful. [ you know the smell of grass ]

You wander off
}

You must traverse a small patch of blue roses to proceed.
You can optionally guide a few bunnies for a gift.

Tentative: 
There's a bunny hole. The hole is occupied and when you step close enough you hear a thump, you thump back instinctively. Out hops a dark tall bunny.
> Hi there, new friend! Have you ever seen such a beautiful burrow before? Please I must beg you to listen to my cautionary instructions. [yes / no]
if yes
	> Take a look at my rabbit hole. You know it is safe, indeed. It smells perfectly normal, remember this. 
	I was guarding the entrance because there is no backend, you should always have a buddy guarding the entrance in case there's a cave-in who else can rescue you? when intruded who else will warn you? / Out hops another bunny / > You see? Remember this.
	> We are great friends now, so you know the hole is safe, because I dug it you may use it as well. Remember this.
	> Sometimes a hole isn't safe because it's bottomless, you should never go exploring in caverns without a whole team, and never ever jump off a sheer cliff. Remember this.

Would you like to take a look inside?
[ if yes the other bunny is still leaving as you try to enter ]
[ if not then you find practice holes, easily skipped ]

> Hey I see you're headed onwards. If you have some time would you help me dig this tunnel?
(I think the player would have been on long enough to be urged to rest)
> You should get some sleep. It's been a big day for you. Come on, there's a cool place right here, or you can sleep in a tunnel, I can keep watch and take turns with my friend while you're "out."
