Bunnies are made of light
Cheese talks

"So there were more...

I thought it was enough. To recognize laws and their command over individual bunnies. To liberate them. A cause! 

There was a 4th law. I need to be Light again. My cause is to be light. I need it back where it was.

I need this. Or I am not me."

Giving the light back, he goes on.

"These 4th laws. These are powerful stories. I bet I could go up to any bunny and lie, so they would adopt the laws. The three laws are absolute, so an entertaining lie will work."

Cooper and soul become resistant to lies that are not entertaining. Stories are retained in the list as usual.

A bunny lie creates new laws and may interfere with current laws.
