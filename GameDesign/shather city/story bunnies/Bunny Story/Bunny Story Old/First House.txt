Bunny walks up to a house.

At a glance, there is a gate, windows, a door, a roof, more than four walls. Up next to the door it sees another bunny. They silently exchange cadences. A light emits from one bunny outside the house into the the other.


"I sense you."

"My name is Eoromwello. I am a domesticated bunny, I am middle aged, five-year-old bunny doe. The bunny outside is wild and so young, it isn't right to judge someone you don't understand.

Don't test me. Time does not pass equally for everyone. I am five.

You are not the first I have met. This sort of thing happens all the time.

There is much for everyone to learn. I can't give you the same experience that I have.  It is something invisible, inside us.  It is up to the individual to seek and determine what is important.

I can tell you something about myself. 

I've lived alone without another bunny my whole life. It's alright. All a bunny needs to go on comes from within.

There is one last thing I can do. I can open your mind. May I?"

The hints collected on the side bar are altered to denote whether they have been proven or not. 

"This is a journal, and it is also a guide. Here are stories you've been told. Stories can be profound influences on your imagination.  Stories can change over time as they are retold.

Stories are a mix of facts and myths. Stories about people spread stereotypes and rumors, as well as facts and myths. 

I will always know if you've found proof about any story. Ask me any time."

There is a fact or myth checkbox for each story. They can also be dragged onto objects to label them for different effects.
