Bunnies in the open meet up with the wild bunny all the time.  Maybe they're trying to say something, they don't always.

Back in Paradise the bunny was too small to be boss. Attempting to lead just made it left alone.  

Now that it has some experience other bunnies appear, greet or say "hit," and follow it around.

A small light furred youngling it meets makes a chore to take care of. If the bunny has a few days to spare it can hang around and watch them grow up. It can even encourage them to be independent.

Some bunnies enjoy digging. Some like adventure. Some run around all the time. Some are just cute.

When they show up and pet each other, that shows a fondness that bunny likes, too. 

The wild bunny boss should do what it can to establish it is in charge in due time. One time it let a bunny roam on the outskirts for a few days and it tried to steal the boss spot!  He managed to be boss though, it gave up and pet him.

Each bunny only needs to answer to one other bunny. This is good practice.  The boss gets to pick whomever it likes to play with, that's a temporary shift in the chain.
