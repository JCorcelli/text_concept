After meeting Light and discovering the bunny lies, the wild bunny returns to paradise with its troop to reveal the underhanded misuse of trust.

Boss of Paradise is gone.

The bunnies look for it all the time now. They don't know where it could have gone. Some think he went on adventure.

The nurseries are opened to the public. Observe and behold, gold and green bunnies galore with just a few gray and brown bunnies mixed in. The legacy of Boss bunny in paradise.

There are causes that drive bunnies to maintain paradise. A number restrain their ambitions, the myths they're told hold them back. The wild bunny has the power to change paradise with the knowledge it has earned and the bunnies it returned with, will it?
