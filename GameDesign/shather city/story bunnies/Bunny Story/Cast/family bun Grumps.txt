Namesake: 'Grump' they're not the nicest bunnies
History: 
They are mostly raised on the Smith farm. They're primarily lop-eared bunnies who've been mixed for several bunny generations to derive their purest reds.

They follow a strict law and mysterious hierarchal system which they roil about constantly.

The red bunnies originated elsewhere, like many of Shather's animals, but the Smith's bunnies were adapted to outdoorsy living.

There is a large house, very much like a barn with many places for them to go to if they are tired.

Secret:

The red fur they are prized for is extremely stimulating fertile properties. Plants can be grown on farms, mushrooms (especially red mushrooms) pop up where they've hopped, and petting a red bunny brings feelings of pleasure. 

They seem to have ways of distinguishing who is who in the pack.

Appearance: 
Generalized description: Reddish pastel. Ears that aren't fully upright even when excited (Lop eared). They leave a trail of red mushrooms behind them.

They are almost identical.
