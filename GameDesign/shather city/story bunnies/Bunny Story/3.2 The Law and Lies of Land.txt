From out of the human stead, a woman with a straw mat emerges. She puts it down in plain view and walks back in.

A Grumpy bunny tells Light "Straw fort is for us." Light then resides at the edge of the straw mat unable to enjoy it, while the Grumpies play and gnaw on it to shreds.  Light won't touch the shreds that part it either.

The story of Grumpy territory is declared as fact and Light behaves as such. You are unable to refute this. The option is removed.

Every time Light walks on or near the mat he is compelled to get off, get away. After a while, he didn't go near it.

Two unusual effects are taking place and Light is making various comments about his perplexity.

When Light walks in daylight he is harder to see. When he does, the law appears "Bunnies are made of Light."

When Light tries to chew the mat he loses his appetite and feels bad. The law also appears briefly: "Straw Mat is forbidden to anyone but Grumpies."


As it passes in its pure form an excess law becomes visible. When selected it enters the story collection.

Light remains unaware until you remove the top 4th law.


4th. Bunnies are made of light
5th. Cheese talks

"Individuality... To understand is difficult. I think I understand.

I need to be Light again. To be myself. I need this cause I've invented, or I am not me."

Light then replaces the "Bunnies are made of light" law with his own willpower.

Giving the light back, he is happy and goes on.

"A cause... It could be anything.

I could go up to any bunny and lie, they wouldn't know how to stop me."

A mischievous grin appears on Light. Light becomes resistant to simple lies with his revelation. Harmless stories are retained in the list instead of going straight to his laws.

A bunny lie interferes with other laws, creating loopholes. A story can deflect a contradicting lie.  If it's too complicated, just try everything.
