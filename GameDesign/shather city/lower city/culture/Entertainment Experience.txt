Merhouits or Merit for short works as a dock hand. She patrols the Stronghold Marina to check for docked boats in the mornings.

Every few days she skips work to go to a petting parlor. There are many high pedigree members at those locations.

Sad Hoppers is her favorite. 

Some of the animals at Sad Hoppers aren't bunnies, but the store's main attraction are numerous bunnies with a depressed look.  They mostly sit calmly and if you pet them too much, turn to look at you accusingly. 

"It's freaking adorable in here!"

Merit has come back to this great place and sits among several sad cute bunnies.
