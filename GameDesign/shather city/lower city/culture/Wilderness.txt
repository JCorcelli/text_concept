Fromp was getting tired of the daily grind. Because of this he decided to play a game.  In this game you go out into an expanse of tall grass on an open-ended exploration.

Fromp goes in no particular direction and sees cats, field mice, and birds during the day.  There are a few points of interest.  There's a hill in the distance, a beach, a cove, and a forest.

In a hilly area are dens dug out by unknown animals. After staring at the dens for a time a burrowing creature spots him and comes closer.  It is dark brown and stiff sheets of matted fur cover its back but its snout is narrow and short furred.

"Very cute, want to touch."

Fromp moves his hand inviting the creature over. It retreates into a burrowed den.  Fromp was vexed, but decided to leave it at that.
