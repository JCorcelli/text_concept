Hekle wakes up and checks their decorative food storage provided by Crill Co. There is not much else on mind and not enough food to last until the foreseeable future.

Few companies deliver straight to Heckle's door, so it's easier to go to the market and purchase what is right there.  With Salty Muffins and Apple Cakes on the mind Heckle could go and buy it right away.  In light of these revelations they get dressed in outdoor clothes and goes straight to the corner market.

There are numerous everyday stuffs like preserved rations and long-lasting grains packed in bags stuffed in bins at Barbie Grocer.  Along side these are tastier preserved fruits, the Crill Co. brand health foods. Heckle especially prefers organic repberry(tm) bars, redberries and pepper just seem to suit their taste buds right now.

After dabbing through some Crill Co. chewy granola bars, Heckle went up to the cashier of Barbie's and made small talk.

"Can you tell me if there are repberry bars in stock?"

"What ever's on the shelf is what we have. Well hold on maybe we just got a delivery, I can do this for you."  The cashier ends this with a little wink.

Ad but! There wasn't anything in stock. Shame. 

The entire marketplace are outlets for both bigger brands and small time store owners. Heckle went to the next outlet store over and was fidgeting with both hands unable to let go of something.
 
Fantsticly Awesome(tm) has all the necessities, fruits and grain proteins.  Heckle bought everything needed and returned home uneventfully. The bags were full of Crill Co. and Silver Cat's, and Jaime Ross stuffs.  It was all necessary and somehow lavishing compared to more generic brands.  Heckle will try and associate the brands with their best products consciously. Ultimately Heckle wants new brands or discounted old brands, but the same old brands are more visible.

The grocery experience over...
