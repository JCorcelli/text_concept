Crystal lives with her stepbrother at Drowslid Square.  Besides him, they share living space with two dogs and a cat.

Heather is a black snouted skinny devil with a mean look, but he's the sweetest guy you'll ever meet.

Severly is a lady to the bone. She rarely make a movement out of place or lose her temperment out of excitement.

Kat, the cat, is the mischievous of the bunch. Really her personality isn't all that unusual, but when Crystal looks at her she thinks there's something going on behind the scenes.

"I have to go  home and check on my family." Is a common phrase uttered in the lower district. It's well known that strays from out of town wander by, and everyone is alerted right away in case anything happens. This doesn't stop the residence from finding every possible reason to go back home and stay with their pets.

[Crystal's stepbrother is a busy-worker and even he comes home]

Crystal's stepbrother is out every day because he works full time. By the end of the day at 5 pm he always leaves, even if he's in the middle of a conversation with a coworker. "I Have to go home to the family." Is all he can think, and often what he says before leaving in a dutiful manner.

Crystal won't even go longer tha 2 hours away from the house. She's practically addicted to looking at Kat, and thinking Kat is just pretending.
