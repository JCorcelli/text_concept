First: Harver
Namesake: Harvester
Age: 4.1
History:
Born on the ground. Learned to tunnel and reinforce rabbit sized ground dwellings from the corp. His mother left to live in the tree temporarily 2 years ago, and is expected back.

Other:
Has a fascination with Crisantha among other young humans. He converses with cats although Sick doesn't like him yet.
He's surprisingly the least intelligent among the animals, seeing as he spends all day relaxing or playing, and his primary job is digging.  This is a very respectable job.

Acquaintences: cat named Sick
Appearance:
Slick black, like the rest of the black bunnies. His features are distinguished easily by the others anyway, his snout is slightly crooked.
He looks incredibly shocked whenever someone first looks at him, a tell.

Secrets:
He hasn't seen the cloud city, he was lost while frolicking out in the soft green fields at just the wrong time at age 3, he wouldn't admit it. During this time he made his own "summer home." It remains separate from the primary tunnel system to this day and had only crude accoutrements.
