Summary:
The "Souths" live in the center of the city by the Southeast.

Whether it was destiny or peer review, they seem to like it there in the south. Most of the family and close cousins live within a 50 mile radius, leaning more towards the waterways in the Southeast more than any other direction.

By the Southeast. There are a number of Fishermen and Boat-builders in their family. Only a few build houses by the river banks. Some even enjoy fishing in cold weather and live up on the glacier.

By the Center. You'll find more mercantile business, and so those who grew fond stay there, plotting and selling fish and sometimes other imported goods they bought.  The free trade is quite smooth.

Speaking of which, the South family is very generous. They'll give you a free fish every day if you befriend them. They have plenty of children who they raise lovingly.

A few of them are working as farm hands, but mostly just to earn their keep while they try to learn the finer points of Central city life.

Other:
Striking an odd balance in irony, they have a few marine mammals for friends.  These swift swimmers are smart enough to avoid the traps and fishing lines. They come right up to look who's baiting before asking for a snack.

The South family ride in boats that mark them. There are two ferries that can depart to the bay area and give people an up close encounter, it's always a crowd pleaser.

Secrets:
There are a few anthromorphs who came down from district four, and they took a liking to the sea. Some of them took the name South, whether they're really family or not, it doesn't seem to matter.  They don't always blend in with humans.
