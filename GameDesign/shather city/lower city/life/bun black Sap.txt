First: Sap
Namesake: Sapling Chewer
Age: 4.3
History:
Born on the ground. Her attention to trees at a young age and her enjoyment of demolishing badly planted saplings allowed her to take her place as one of the bunny tree cutters.
Not only cutting, but also planting seeds, and she has a high intellect which lets her catch onto most human activities. She's allowed access to computers when she's with the right people.

Other:
Studying human nutrition on the side, she mostly enjoys fallen branches and saplings that grow too close to bigger trees, and in the way of their tunnels.

Appearance:
Appears to have little slightly darker patches near her hind legs. She licks her lips a lot when around fresh bark.

Secrets:
She wants to eat human food but understands the danger. She studies to someday aide in the digestion of human foods in bunnies and other animals. Possibly further human understanding of bunny anatomy is necessary.
