A much more rich story is the Shather residents' connection to nature.

Dogs are just the surface and feign normalcy. The people who live on the ground remain mundane in appearance because they call animals pets. They're a great conversation piece, and so cute, you just have to see them! 

Their pets often encounter those from the upper world and gain intelligence.  What comes as a greater surprise is that the animals on the ground can sometimes start to really understand human speech.

Note: Shather upper has a society of intelligent animals.

The rabbits are among the most robust breed, found in many places, but they actually remain closer to the ground level than the rest of the species around. The "black bunnies" developed a tunnel system, living off the land, at great risk of failing to match the higher ups intellect they find a lot of love.

Animals rarely develop human vocal communication. They learn written word, and advance their own methods. Symbols remains a constant across all animals and humans alike.  It may come as no surprise that the written English system and memes are regular. The internet is popular, but proves very often to be unfriendly.

Some of the best inventions from the animals are better resource provisions, recycling, improved vegetables. Hardware that can track and report interlopers. Methods for vertical transportation, and infrastructure on the pillar.  Some of the most respected animals inspect hardware on a daily basis and frequently detect problems that would result in critical failure months in advance.
