The people of Shather city try to keep their appearances intact.  Claims from the outside world that they are anti-modernist are frequent. The following is the true lifestyle of Shather's residence.

There is an angelic people who live in the thicket of the southwestern mountain range. Above the first few branches and the sun berries there is an advanced society which existed for a long time. They have animal companions, they work together, trying to increase their love with social bonds. A self-sustaining society of millions of people who want to share each other more than they possibly ever can.

Recycling is paramount. Eight hours every day, someone is either moving the reusable goods or inventing new ways to use them.

Rather than building on flat land, the angels of Shather must build upwards, toward the heavens. It's a novel idea, probably the one thing that makes the name angel stick, and this means they need to renew old infrastructure, and understand their limited environmental economy, and never work against its nature.

The tree-like structures themselves aren't exactly trees, but mega-trunks of interlacing pillars which form as hard as titanium and deposit soil and nutrients to their roofs in flat clouts.

Their ancestors built upon the first ancient tree over three millennia ago by replanting its own cultivated offspring.

All in all, the people up in Shather's upper limits live in a soft cloudy tree with unfailing comfort and dignity. Only on a rare occasion they need to use the knowledge gained by conversing with the humans surrounding them. The kin who live on the surface do this, continuously.

Those who live below are just as important for the ecosystem, and maintaining secrecy.
