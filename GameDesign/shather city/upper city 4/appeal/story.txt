After the first expansion, the great tree seeds previously discovered were looked into,. There were an assortment which were hardy, and hearty. The people took a vote for which tree would be grown next, to make the best ceiling for district three, and start on district four.

Out of all the possibilities, a prismatic seed was presented which they believed would filter the sunlight through beautifully, ever-changing.  How they came to this conclusion, it took some time and speculation. The same process was used, where they cultivated a sapling, and then observed its properties. It did appear to have the desired affect on light, and it was sturdy, not so dissimilar to their current habitat.

It was planted at the core, in the same manner, and the process took hold. The tree transformed partway up and it blossomed into bright glorious colors. It went up above their highest buildings and spread outward in a multitude of speckled palettes.

This "new wilderness" was not easy like the lands they understood, it was pretty though. Before anyone stepped foot on the new unexplored district, it had already begun to generate life that never could have existed in nature.

Any of the angels and animals who ventured into this wilderness gained a strange magical essence.  Their children were changed, some became animal-crossed humanoid anthromorphs.  The anthromorphs were accepted as intelligent, whether they were angel or animal, equal kin after a few decades of heightened interest where they were thought to be closer to nature and closer to god.

The angels gained a slight aversion to sprouting a new district immediately because of the upheaval. Precautions were then placed for more stable tree cultivation in the future.  During this time some anthromorphs thought they needed to try harder to be trusted, and they became all the more pleasant and familiar with the angels, and started a similar culture in district four despite the ever changing life there.
