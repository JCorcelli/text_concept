EXAMPLE OF GAME COLLECTIONS

Soup
You need stuff for a soup.  You store vegetables in a bag. You mark them off a list.

Eventually you heat water in a pan, then you cut the vegetables and drop them in the boiling water.


Magic spell
Individual letter characters could be physical. Say you need magic letters to write a spell and you organize them on paper one letter at a time.  There's a pre-drawn spell to fill in.

After finishing, you ink it. The inked part of the paper is saved. You trace a line over the inked part to invoke a spell.

PERMANENCE
