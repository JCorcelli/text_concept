set didn't work on the Unity vectors I was assigning

o pictures add indent

o vertices are efficient

z
I have to get my string for the cursor from somewhere else
o	I just need to save this info
		i_paragraph 
		i_line
		i_word
		i_char
		
	calculations
o		string searching
		hover checks
		
		
			o paragraph
			
			o line
			
			o word
			o char
			
			
!		using selectabstract
			1 hover component
			2 give me the first thing I touch
			
			any artistic text - only char distance matters
			
		o highlight rects =
			whatever rect hit
			
			use the cursor info text
			o backed as c.info.textunity
			remade with the castpoint function
				o lines understand me
				o paragraphs are good
				o word 
					highlight
				o edit carrot
				
			
				o char is fine
				
!		I define the inserts?
			all widgets upper left anchor because resize
			widget size?
			only some widgets work
				
				xxx
			right insert just automatically takes 3 chars and cuts them out
			o left insert
			
			o inline insert
				
		moving as object=
			I'd need a renderer, I simply move it
			
			
			as verts? unless it important, no


o	
need to know where cursor is - call the functions in order:
	paragraph - paragraph, line
	line - word, char
	(distance to chars?)
	or just
	
	o 
	pointCast(mousePosition) all necessary variables are local to the text body atm
	
x
need to know where indents are 
	technically I do when it's first created.
	So as long as the widgets don't move, their indent is the same spot.

Any reason (not) to
	image software imitation
	try turning text into image
	
	?
	improving old prototype
	try saving datesim image (smarter saving ability)
	?
	
	understanding font
	check out custom font in unity, maybe I can 
	?
	
finish it
	node should have a default size when active
	let the node move body if it isn't dragged
	let the node display 
		a different text if collapsed?
	the node doesn't move unless it's dragged

Any reason (not) to
Master this
o	text - pretty much forced me to learn how vector was implemented
	texture - is a matter of walking huge lists not unlike the way text is handled
	vector - is a rather short list of positions now that I think of it.

x
there is also the expensive operations, gpu and overlay * maybe later?

	x shader - is a language I'd have to learn to program expertly for the gpu (in the end it's all pixels)
	x after effect - means pixel operations right i'll ignore those for now


##PROGRESS AND THOUGHTS
o I have a text that can simulate chat
I want to insert anything into the memory list
	I could insert an option to open a widget (eg collapsed)
	I could make any widget appear and scroll
	How about a more standard widget with info transmitted from (user unknown)
I want to modify anything from source
	Add scripted values to them
o I have images that don't need to be modified
I have widgets that do need to be modified (headers)
I want to modify things - program them


## GOALS ETC
hub
proc sets text
hub on change

o
I made magnetbubble
o
use the actions, make bubble appear, grow

make bubble grow slowly
o
a real dialogue box
o
the current memory controlling selected and new widgets in its list, and outside its list to some degree
	This is meant to be organized
	Know all memories at all times

	all memorybox rects are memories with potential text, and widgets options

	node states:
		collapsed, anchored collapsable, detached screen-bound, invisible (not in zone or not in use)

memory widgets
	prevwidget methods select a memory's content and alters it after the text position is calculated.
		there's not really anything to do to fix this besides rebuilding the text, or never resize/move widgets.

> elements, see: item vs elements
	memorybox to organize the elements
	Drag the elements
	(it's an inventory screen?)

> text generator component (eg not the memory node)
	something easy to alter/distribute that doesn't rely on node.

> widgets created by mbox
	properties__________
	
	text
		pad
		string
		background
		outline
		highlight - if hovered
		color
		size
		font
	
		italic, bold
	
	
	non-text? just wing it later
