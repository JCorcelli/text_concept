I set up a super cursor class atm
	it's a circle outside text - i shouldn't use it like this
	it's a highlight in text

CursorInfo
FocalCursor

circle (mouse)
	rect (hover highlight)
	
	I need a focus highlight that doesn't move with cursor or something

highlight
word recolor
I could make colored words by copying the text, changing the color, covering the old text

word reveal
like a lense

x editing

o i set up the 2d cursor now I just feel like I want that 3d cursor to cooperate


>	
have a default selectabstract > cursornode without requiring text.
I embed a selectabstract > cursortext (currently the main cursorinfo) if I need it, just make the text big enough

the alternative is to check if I hover a selectabstract, then I see if it has cursor info

? maybe I shouldn't always be moving the camera
