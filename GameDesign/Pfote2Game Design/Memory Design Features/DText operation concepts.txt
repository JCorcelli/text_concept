split stream, fake user
	parallel DText, it should spawn a fake user, it can have any properties
	
is just an idea...
modify, DText ... endmodify
	like a mediaproc, targets a DText to store this in as it reads.
	this method circumvents filtering
	
	it is sensible to behave like mediaproc
	"add a fresh DText to storage and write to that, it will appear to be like any other DText
	"
	or similar to a join
	"find a recording device (pencil+paper, camera) and target the last DText
	"
	this is cryptic
	"any !readOnly DText not in use, proc or goal
	"

mediaproc, real user
	trigger a media proc in user with split text
join stream
	modify DText.storedText, it should target another stream's goal text
just run a method
	no parsing required? just write a method
