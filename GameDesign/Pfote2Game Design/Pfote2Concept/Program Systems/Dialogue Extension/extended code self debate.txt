It's like lambda

"" text
{method params} lambda function

I thought I want namespace
{using wiki/user} at the base of the string could change the namespace, which means all future function calls are "wiki/user"

many possible namespaces
	World - pretty much for debugging
	Magic - magic spells
	Law - a restrictive wordplay
	
	Wiki - the wiki code imitator
	Memory - the log that probably uses basic DBox stuff
	
DECLARATION
A better idea is to make a name convention

DAction("Magic.Box") is not DAction("MagicBox")
Wiki/Main.Box would refer to drawing a box in the wiki.

WORLD FUNCTIONS

{DBox.NewLine} could just be {NewLine} because DBox was first, and currently the only organized text generator.

CONVERSION?
DText => Wiki ? No. Only the functions are different. No point.
