Technically. The text is the state. (see  finite memory )


function ideas, also see markup magic
text user assignment
	
	{user is Jess}
	{target is Korna}

finite state machine (control flow suggestion)
	{start} - a sandbox variable mode
	
	set {user volume 12} psst psst psst
	{end} - reverts
	
x	{set 1 {user volume}} - this totally uses a variable {1}
	{if {user volume} 12} one frame
	{while {user volume} 12} per frame

is volume even real?
