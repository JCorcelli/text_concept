 JUST WRITE, AND I WILL PARSE IT LATER, THEN I WILL WRITE THE METHODS	
		
non destructive mutator
	{SoftMutate [chars] [replace]}
destroying or altering marks
	
	part of text could be messing up a memory
	How do I target it? 
	
	find " "
	replace " "
	remove " "
	
	It's process of elimination since there can be nested or barred.
	
	I think mutators could do this. If I just program mutators to perform a splice operation it's fine.
	


"COUNTDOWNS"
	example: {CountDown 10} count its parameter down to 0, performing a function each call.
	
*
	{sleep [n] } set advance to 0 for n seconds
	
*
	{wait [n] [text]} after n seconds the broken out [text] is acted. Sseful for sequences.
	
	
"ESCAPED TEXT"
	example: {escapefunc param [text]} get escaped leaving [text]
	
*
	{randomtext ["text","{cps 12}wha..{cps}"]}

DESTRUCTIVE	COUNTDOWNS
	
*	
	{Chaos 30 "text"}
	continuously replacing "text" with chaos 
	
*
	{EscapeAfter 30 {Destroy 100}} 
	count its parameter down to 0, then destroy 100 text characters.

	
PARSER
I
targeting certain Streams by method
	{think holy cow} display at an indent nearly instant
	{say holy cow} main text
	{* cough} instantaneous

	affect
	but actions like think or say prevent them from performing something.

II
param variable altering
	{text IsClever bool}
	{user IsClever bool}
	{stream IsClever bool}
	{storage IsClever bool}
