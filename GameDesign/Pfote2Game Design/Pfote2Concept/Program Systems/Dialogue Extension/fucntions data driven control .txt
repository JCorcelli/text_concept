This is an alternative to finite state machine control. One that is data driven.

 JUST WRITE, AND I WILL PARSE IT LATER, THEN I WILL WRITE THE METHODS


WHAT I WANT HERE

important: the parser should handle logic per frame. This would be spur of the moment, only.

control statements: escaped, or not escaped?
	these are basically extreme mutators. They would be escaped in memory, or they'd be chaos.
	
	
	{if {condition} {then} {else}} 
	
	{while {condition} {dothis}} hmm...
	{repeat 10 "booyah "} filter not equalling stored text because it's not information.
	
knowledge use - having a string at cached memory
	
	{if {cache subject} yes I remember}
	
variable use - having a variable opinion of subject
	{if {opinions var} {Opine var}}
	
var assignment - taking info over current info
	{if {thinking} {ReplaceRecent green red}}
	
	string operation
	
	string interpretation (as state)
	

I could use memory references.

	people's first names
	""
	Jess
	Jack
	Mark
	""


	{if Jack in people's first names yes I know Jack}
