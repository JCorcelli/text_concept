	(icon) bell, red light, spiky cloud, neg. words, droopy ears
	(anthro) pained expression
	
lures that attract bunny (food, plant)
	1. ball
	2. particles
	3. musical notes
	4. unusual/ new things
	5. soft textures
	
	(icon) pos. words, sun, "?", arrows, plants (food), hand, uppy ears

HOW THE GAME HANDLES THE LOGIC***********
maybe
thinking of a trap
	a trigger initiates the effect sequence
	initial animation plays forcing a target in/out
	
	display effects
		
	a more forceful barrier is placed, can't be passed

Disengage a lure if it fires frequently so they aren't so dumb

I could disengage the repel by moving the target indicator to the desire indicator's position, outside the influence.
