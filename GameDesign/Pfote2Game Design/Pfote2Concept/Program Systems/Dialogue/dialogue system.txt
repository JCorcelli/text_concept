 JUST WRITE, AND I WILL PARSE IT LATER, THEN I WILL WRITE THE METHODS
 
DBoxAction for text, pretty much covered

	
StaticDialogueHub
	StaticDialogueHubHook - for callback
	
	
Dialogue Text...
xTextMesh, idk how to use it yet
Dialogue Box - parse, organize, visualize, getting pretty close to the seven senses of the body

Static D. BoxAction - ease of use

In abstract terms
	User = Resource, Target, Scripted 

	Stream = Sense, Use, Parse, Display


Hierarchy coupling

	string

	BoxAction
	D Action
	
Object > D. User

	Text 
		Storage {Mutator}

	Storage
