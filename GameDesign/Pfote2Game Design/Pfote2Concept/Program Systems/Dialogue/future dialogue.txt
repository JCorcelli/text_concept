AUGMENTED DIALOGUE GAME

 JUST WRITE, AND I WILL PARSE IT LATER, THEN I WILL WRITE THE METHODS
 
 
The conversation [should be] cleverly displayed.
	easy to look at in code
		parse
		read after being filtered
	
	dialogue box
		text with prefabs 
			image, icon, deliberate link, misc. ui input
			
	option box
		???
		location
		conversation
		linked info?
		[variable]hidden option
		???

I should add elements I can click in the text
	
the known data needs to be auto-linked.  Clicking opens a memory log
	wiki metaphor
		hyperlink to page
		page association
			similar proper nouns
			timeline
		just like wiki there can be multiple pages, multiple sections
	
		
the options or thoughts generated are something to be premade, and should be reviewable.

puzzles are replayable.
