target is avatar

Rule: keep the face of target on screen

Free - sneak - default
	1 a camera follows with movement
	2 camera walks ahead of movement, slightly
	
	3 look turns the camera
	4 ctrl behaves like zone
	5 shift makes bunny sit still, and when you hold look it'll walk, but it returns on release (movement is reserved)
	
freeform - choice
	Pressing "C" could swap in freeform
	camera follows with some adjustment

	obstacles - camera would be best with character in center
	
	race - face the "lane" you drive in and turn with character, see distant obstacles
	
	bird - like obstacles but camera would pan far ahead
	
	fight - or the target you choose 
		signal = target
		camera over the shoulder
	sneak - camera should keep angle best for viewing
	
zone (regular)
	1 signal, hold to observe
	2 similar to sneak
	
zone (empower spirit)-
	pointer locks at center
	1 enter first person
	2 wasd moves in space like walking
	3 turn the camera look normally
	4 signal normally
	5 jump pushes you into air, wasd camera pans and zooms
	
	

tactical path (reserve for minigame and map)
	camera follows a set path
	1 it's locked
	2 it's outside the normal distance
	
a cinematic eye 
	1 should watch for cues. 
	2 while I'm not running it can halt if the bunny halts

	3 observant - could  watch very closely on something, augmented even, predicting its next move

target skewing
I need to keep the mouse in the same spot most of the time
maybe this would give a necessary "fear" effect? Losing control.

controlling
outside a lot of things could be moving
This would mean I have to turn before I walk


I think if I open a screen, I want some way to get closer, how?	
	observe
	
turn fast. 
	no, the game's easy on the eyes.
	
turn while I run.
	no...
