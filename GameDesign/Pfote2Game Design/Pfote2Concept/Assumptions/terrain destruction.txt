there are the skills, dig, ram, and explosive.  These could dig out chunks, but there's also tunneling which should make a neat line.

some areas need to reset, so I can probably record the line already made, allowing reuse.

dig - take a voxel chunk out
ram - 
	1 damage random chunks as well as a damage the closest chunk
	2 dig several voxels, and damage the surrounding chunks
explosive - 
	1 voxelize chunk in radius
	2 vaporize in radius
	
	
tunneling
tunnel - first cut creates an entrance

	1 cut a given distance for a shortcut
	2 cut along a plane, and change your angle at will
secret turnnel - cover the entrance

terrain refresh - replaces damaged parts
	1 damaged surfaces of buildings, ground
	2 designated puzzles
	3 some unstable terrain

what if I try to build?
	i'll see what I can do. but does it really make sense for a bunny to build?
