MIND INCURSION - ATTACK ZONE

bomb - bunny exclusive
hand - keeper exclusive
other. undecided, 
	some wild animals have strong mental defenses
	some pets have impenetrable defenses

Each character gets their own mind zone.

BARRIER 1 - trust zone
Before you even see anything there's a spirit shield.  You need to walk inside it physically.

B 2 - attack zone
the zone. after entering the mind, you see the layout the first time, and have to attack the file you want.

the opposition will disable and throw you out, probably.

B 3 - subconscious zone/ gain control
mind zone. the 3D plane, or some other. Here you wrest control.  It can be thought of as a DREAM zone.

A lot of the thought elements are here, but it's articulated metaphorically, visually, and difficult to get exact results.

B 4a - covert mind control/ infiltrate
This is a lot like breaking into a heavily secure area, just to steal a security guard's watch.

All the data and info are here, but stuff's pushing you to the forced exit, which completely pushes you out of the zone. This is more challenging, and you only access one variable at a time.

Each success should increase the difficulty until the special ability is used on you.

B 4b - mind control

After subconscious control you have full access and memory log.
