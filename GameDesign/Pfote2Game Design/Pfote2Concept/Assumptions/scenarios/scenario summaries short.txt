Alright I have written a bunch of different things down, each of which are worthy of being a game, they are completely unrelated.  So this is more like flavor text to me, learning the systems makes up most of the gameplay.

"SOCIAL STORY"
There's one main story that I already wrote a tutorial for and it is the backbone of the game. It'll have a frame of time in which it develops. 

It's somewhat summarized by the end of the game if you (somehow) miss it.  You'd have to go out of your way to miss it, really.

None of the code will be procedural, and it's not a roguelike or random story, but I expect emergent stories based on vanilla gameplay and experts if anyone decides to exploit the systems mentioned.


"PESONAL STORY"
Personal stability, memories fade and distort, it's really intriguing.

Well, there's an innocent little bunny to consider.  If he starts to feel bad that's almost a game over. Number one conflict confirmed, take care of the bunny. Number two conflict, it's fun to hack reality?


Some basic level building systems for improving various skill and quirky encyclopedic knowledge. Bunneh can become powerful for pleasure AND profit. 

Exploration -heroism, exploitation, foolish choices. It takes on many forms.

I wrote a linear low conflict (optional) puzzle adventure that... you will probably veer off the time sensitive story because this one's a bit easier to comprehend.

Also there's an important thing. Being cute is for the truly underhanded, or beginners, and it's an option.
