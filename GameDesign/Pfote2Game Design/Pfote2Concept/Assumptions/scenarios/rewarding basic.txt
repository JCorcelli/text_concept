ENDGAME
walk on walls - notably it is an overpowered ability

flying - this could be better than walking on walls, it's much faster hopping

invisibility - better than stealth, but would you make noise?

earplug - the decisive method of muting all dialogue and annoyance at once (actually that's balanced)
