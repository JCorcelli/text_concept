SOCIAL - SIN FIENDS, ALTERNATIVE VIEW
FIENDS (x4), well it was apparently the fiendish encounters

ACT 2 - FIENDS (x4)
it should be based on symbols Shather is adorned with?

THE SINS - SHATHER (more than >4)
	SIN FIENDS, perversion of human culture
	
	1 suppressing knowledge - myth, secrets, hidden keeps, hidden in plain sight
		magic?
		story?
		suppressed information is danger
		
	2 technology - a power disparate of natural evolution, creating its own meaning.
	
	3 purity - angels obsessed with a cause that no longer has reason.
	
	4 social entropy - systems that have risen from order to become obstacles and chaos (games, diversion)
	
	---
	EXTRA
	
	base
	5 dream - desire
	6 nature - plants animals
	7 senses - texture
	
	landmark
	8 iceberg
	9 tree
	
	
	INTERNAL STRUGGLE
	
	leaving shather is a culture shock after all
	
WHO CAN BE THE FIENDS?
	keepers of the hidden keeps...
	friends
	
KEEPERS
	they'd be introduced as bosses... it's a bit less amazing.
	
THE FRIEND TWIST	
	how about beating them makes them characters in the main? Then there's no reason to have extra characters other than to throw people off.
	
MAIN CHARACTER FRIENDS
	
	1 interested > knowledge - someone obsessed with myth, knows too much for his own good.
	2 generous > tech - wealthy, knows little, but has everything to offer.
	3 selfish > purity - a bastard who can manipulate, take, and give nothing (above reproach)
	4 guilt > entropy - an exhausting source of entertainment
