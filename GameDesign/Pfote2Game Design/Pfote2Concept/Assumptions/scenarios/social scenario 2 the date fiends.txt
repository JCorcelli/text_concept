MANIPULATION? MAIN TWIST?
leveling up the fiends? You help them level up, before the finale, contributing to your agency.
This makes the game less random, and it's even more like a sim date game. Odd and interesting means in between.

STEALTH PUZZLING?
the idea of sneaking past them to avoid interrupting. If you're seen you could be stopped and used.

It's just as interesting as saying you try to get involved while they ignore you. It creates a conflict when your presence is a factor.
