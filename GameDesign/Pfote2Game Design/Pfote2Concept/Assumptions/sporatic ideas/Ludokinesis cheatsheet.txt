Mental defenses are good. Ludokinesis (LuK) will get through all of them. 


GAME with story DESIGN
Bottom up design.  
1 Program the basics for dialogue, interacction
2 interpret the geometry
3 add the story
4 script triggers (cutscenes)

Top down design.
1 write story
2 block together actions from the story, determine triggers, structure
3 code story in syntax, with action blocks
4 program the actions
5 script ai routine
6 script story triggers, contextual input

note the audio, graphics, and years of practice in any discipline aren't mentioned. Simply learning to play video games is a potential challenge.

STORY SETTING BLOCKS
1 Geometry allows basic interaction
2 Identifying used objects enables higher functioning action
3 Ads, aka mob or obstacles, create active interference
4 Decoration, free, create static interference


BEHAVIOR-OR-HARD-CODED ACTION BLOCKS

predict: form expectation
plan with options: The use of tactics, strategy, interacting with mob, ob, Goal, to reach a desired state shows a planning skill.

perform: performance is sound, visual to convey intent, player feedback

result is a transaction, feedback
success is met expectation
evaluate the unexpected turns


COUNTER PLOT
From the ending, work backwards, predict ACTION BLOCKS instead of aimless wandering.

"Seven basic plots" (wikipedia): 
	Overcoming the Monster
	Rags to Riches
	The Quest
	Voyage and Return
	Comedy
	Tragedy
	Rebirth

NARRATIVE PATTERNS are meant to be observed and relied on by the audience. It's like, an opportunity to read between the lines.

	Rule of three, things come in threes, good or bad.

	Good vs. evil, alignment is expected.
	
	
NARRATIVE DIALOGUE
	STRUCTURE linear, nonlinear, interactive (games)
	FORM determines the information in the story.
	POV position and character of the storyteller, in relation to the narrative
	VOICE "essential" sets up the story for the player. Thought process, reading a letter, retelling experiences.
	TENSE past, present, future

STATE, PLOT
Game state reflects progress (of plots), tracking behavior of character, status of all npc

NULL REACTION
An action in the world has to be forgotten or forgiven for a story to resync with planned events. 

LUDOKINESIS (Lk)
Intro, mnemonic, reflection, redundancy.

	As an occupational calling it can lead to catharsis, and the belief of something greater.
	
	As observation it can be imitated or characaturized.
	
	As V.G. Trope, strange rules npc and pc follow reinforce ludokinesis, sometimes affects real life.

LEARNING
The lesson and behavior modification that may take place through some school of thought.

NPC, ANIMAL
	CLASSICAL CONDITIONING applies to correlating multiple stimuli to a response found in.
	OPERANT reward and punishment suits imperative behaviors.
	LAG a misunderstood, but well meaning delay in response
	
NPC, HUMAN COGNITION
	TOKEN MEMORY of symbols, postures, memes, activates at intro, meme, and mnemonic levels.
	PATTERNS apply to humans.
	PATTERN REINFORCEMENT is mnemonic, suits critical thinking behaviors.
	OBSERVATION is imitation, and may apply to any sense or memory.


PC
	FLOW STATE is where behavior, thought has no difficulty for long periods.
	REST is the act of simple pleasure, results in entropy over long periods.

	DEATH is punishment with nothing, EXTINGUISHED BEHAVIOR resulting from extreme stress or injury can be perceived as TRAUMA.

PLAYER
	CHALLENGE should be more difficult than perceived FLOW STATE but easily overcome with OOC SKILL.

	TUTORIAL is a method of intro to player, without interfering with PC. A tightly closed loop that ensures bare minimum excess, with a single success state.

META (ALL EXPERIENCE MATTERS)
LESSON is an interactive flow state.

LESSON PLAN is a macro that demands extended challenges and flow states.

HARD SKILL can be uncannily weak in some areas. Shouldn't be required for casual players.

EASY CHOICE the result of simply choosing has weight, because there is potential. Only has moral weight.

BRANCHED PATHS or CHANGE OF MIND is a potential for choice.


TACTIC is an action that takes advantage of skills TACTIC LESSON use skill to solve puzzles, situational awareness.

STRATEGY, use of INTEL a use of gathering situational knowledge. STRATEGY LESSON a scenario that involves multiple steps, GATHER INTEL, PLAN, and EXECUTE, where any mistake results in failure.
