...forcing gameplay into menus would be highly annoying: but if players elected to seek power by menuing then I could ramp up the difficulty, risk - reward
	this was because I thought I could turn menus into cursor mazes, and then don't-touch-wall mazes, and then maybe cursor gain powers aka spirit powers
	
...I could put little traps that the cursor falls into, and without it, your pointer has less power
	there could be things to drag on screen, and it turns out the cursor is what does the dragging - unless the pointer is a hand

?...At the deepest levels of the psyche the cursor could transform, and the player will make some obvious connection.

...and the reason I don't just react to the mouse is... this is a setup to make the cursor VISUALLY ALIVE
