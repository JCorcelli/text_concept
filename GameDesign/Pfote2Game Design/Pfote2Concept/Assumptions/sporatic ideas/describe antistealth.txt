title: anti-stealth bunny i ear

i may be able to put this into words now

The basic idea is if bunny stays hidden too long, it's boring. Sometimes a bunny needs to get some eyes, full attention, spotlight, until everyone turns to look, then go back into hiding after the excitement is too much.

This idea reflects how people wish reality worked, it is not intended to be realistic at all. It is intended to ignore the stereotype that stealth is limited to just "stealth" games.

Working example. There's a bunny that is many times smaller than the size of the general inhabitants in its world (mainly around a cage near someone's bed). Sometimes, while being paid little attention, he (the bunny) goes under the bed, or around a corner, and it knows nobody sees, when he goes in the shadows, he practically vanishes.

Being in the shadows sounds safe. Nothing will ever find him there.

Actually, being in the shadows isn't great. Being in the shadows is worrisome. Nobody will ever find him. Not even the hand that pets him!
