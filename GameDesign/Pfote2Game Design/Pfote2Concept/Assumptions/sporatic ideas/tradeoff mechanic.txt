tradeoffs

trading sense of smell for animal repellant

the idea that you can get a boost in ability by losing something intrinsicly valuable.

I imagined having a character use some potent animal repel, and in doing so its horrible side-effect knocks them out, signifying a big change.

They are able to use the repellent, but lose their sense of smell.  By losing this they no longer gain knowledge about smell, they can't use it anymore. (sounds like invincible saint)
