MOVEMENT 
I included a lot of excess movement potential while describing the game to myself.


The core movement is actually two options: click or hold the mouse, and Bunneh goes there. Also optionally: wasd or arrow controls.

You can conveniently turn the camera.

More advanced movement is in the works, for fun.  A bunny that can run and jump!

There are more than four different ways to jump set as a goal.  A familiar jump is always available, it's a matter of finding the jump button. But there are also secret techniques.

Even if you aren't great with the core movement, from idle you can bounce or slingshot your way, although it will start off a bit slowly.

There are other powerful options in the works.  What can be achieved by hopping shouldn't be ignored.
