there are obstacles A,B,C
completing the activities [a],[b],[c]

escalation for interest gain

Initial control experimented, I progress


escalation 1- 
	goal, conflict
	
	
	1 I want to [b] now
	2 I want to [b] now, but have to [a] first to survive A
	
	A prevents [b]
	
	
	I thought
	"midway through level 2 or 3"
	
	
escalation 2-
	
	A stops me from progressing
	I learn how to [a]
	
	I [a]
	I [b], and get something
	i want more B and less A
	
	A is between me and B constantly
	I [a] encounter B
	
	I'm expecting A>B [ab] and...
	
escalation 3-
	
	Introducing C, is in my way
	Now I have to [c]
	
escalation 4-
	
	now there's more A.
	
	C>A>C>A>A, and no B in sight
	
this pattern is super mario bros. 1-1

there are a few "bonus" interactions that add incredible depth
A, goomba, can be killed with good aim
B, ?Block, gives you a power for touching it


[a], jump
[b], touching (approximately)
[c], [jump] climbing skill

all these things are jumping

beyond escalation-
	Warp pipe
	
	Pits
	
	Invisible blocks
	
in conclusion super mario bros. silently tutors their players within seconds, and the rest of the game is based on the knowledge and cultivating this skill

another design step is the domino, multiplicative gameplay. 

action [db] can have the same result of [aaaa,b]
kicking a shell into 4 goombas and a ?block, and the shell comes back at you, fast A.


If the game was a question it'd be, how do I reach Z?
the answer is [a], but it'd be easier with [a-y].  It teaches you [a] very well.  As for how you [z]. That's everything.
