I think it'd be cool if something auto-generated like a meta-ball mesh, but it'd have to correctly set space to walk on eg. erase what's there 

big
zoom out
expand a wide area and place decals randomly

have npcs alter it, like a biome, so it's like the place grew and became inhabited

small
alter the decals
cutting holes through mesh
raising platforms

physics
it'd have to be like time is frozen
I could decide if something needs to move
I could turn the physics on for an area

npcs
I'd determine which ones get special traits. So yeah, all npcs would have to share a common makeup
