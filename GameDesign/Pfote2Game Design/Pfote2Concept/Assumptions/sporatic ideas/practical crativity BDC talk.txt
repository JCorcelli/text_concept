he says game he means 
	rules
	goals
	conflict
	

small games are bricks

	M: an innovation revealed as a brick is probably hard to see

make them learn things

goals are created around displayed stats

game is extended by "moves / dimensions"

games are on timers
	M: slowing the ai down makes it more believable
	
working with constraint on purpose "time honored classic creative tool"
	M: it's easier to identify it as a brick
	
conflicted goals : deal damage, don't take damage
	M: attract repel dilemma
	
	
"It's easy to make a game. Our failure is a complete lack of imagination."
M: So he means use an experience, and build a game around it... but apparently if you use old rules it's not new, it's an innovation.

I think I can describe this GDC as a game

suggest a problem
give the audience a goal
teach them new things
reward them with phrases like "see, it's easy"

He sums it up with top down, bottom up game design. "the game can be about friendship. use friendship as a mechanic"

M: ok I wrote a story, I'm trying to abstract that story
