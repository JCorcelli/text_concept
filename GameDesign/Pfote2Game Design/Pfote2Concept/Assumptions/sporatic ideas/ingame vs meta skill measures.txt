meta. the cursor as a protected resource that travels the screen, between dimensions.
	
	it could have powers: earn or lose?
	
	lose mentality
	moving objects 2d/3d - only they are lost if you get 'trapped'
	activating objects - thoughts, signalled
	activating menus - activating
	using powers - storing items
	
	earn it first m.
	discovering a maze and navigating it to release the trapped cursor (2d / 3d)
	
	it becomes a support character then.
