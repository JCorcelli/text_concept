What Bunneh sees/finds reveals everything, yet tells nothing.

This first game explores in detail the core mechanics, interacting, common skills. Move, click, drag, watch Bunneh eat, sleep, play... do bunny stuff. Do non-bunny stuff.

There's much to explore, discoveries to be made, a sense of achievement awaits Bunneh and his friends. Try anything, Bunneh can't resist.

TL;DR Be brave. Pet a bunny. Mouse + Keyboard. Hints on/off.
