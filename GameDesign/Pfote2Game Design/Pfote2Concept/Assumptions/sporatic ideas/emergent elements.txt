is there some way to intentionally allow emergence in all aspects of game experience?

example of learning a real world craft in game (courtesy of legendary moonlight sculptor)

sculpt in VR (with your hands) = sculpt a mesh
or guide generates a predefined preference, enhancing your skill
then you bring them to life and they behave like NPCs do
mesh manip = make your own models
bring to life = models are essentially playable characters

pro - you do learn, you craft a path of victory
con - it takes time to earn, you're free labor for the dev team

some from my book

example of emergent puzzle system
log event (exact event order are 'rare')
log becomes unique
log manip = define your character
low diary = write your own story

pro - you are becoming critical thinking, you can use what you learn in game. You're not limited to that.

con - it's limited to restrain you at first, and later it's a triviality to be a hypocrite that can't make up their mind and procrastinate on what to try next before resetting the game

example of emergent code/game rules

standard law = standard behavior game
law manip = choice of game
pro - you can partially alter the core behavior of the world
con - not everything you want will be there
eg.
	"dreams are real"
	"city laws don't apply to bunnies"
	"bunnies aren't pets"
...

emergent npc behavior, pretty much every light novel
"artificial intelligence"
...
emergent plot
choose your character = motive
choosing a starting world = setting
your actions in the world = defining the character

pro - your possibility space is infinite.
con - the above creates a story with the premise of emergence, but without a unifying story

if all else fails put game modding tools into the game
