3d person movement
1 unmotivated camera movement doesn't look where the player wants.
it could be affected
redirected
unable to look
or become cinematic

2 motivated camera (normal) looks exactly where the player wants
in this case the character and onscreen content is secondary.
Cues are required, outside camera cues
The player is essentially 1st person with the character moving at their whim so they lose importance.

1st person movement
1 unmoctivate isn't impossible but it's  more like a fight
2 motivated is the player controls and everything follows
