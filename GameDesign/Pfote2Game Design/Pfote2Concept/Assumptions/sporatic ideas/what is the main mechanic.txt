MOVEMENT - SIMPLE
Here you can walk, run, and jump.

You can do a basic jump many ways, your choice.
shift, click - a normal jump

mouse then shift - the run and jump, simple and a good vertical dodge to jump over things

space and...
drag release - dive and dash
shift, click - slingshot a little farther than a normal jump


I keep telling myself jumping is not the most interesting mechanic.  Ultimately, it's fun, and just as important to the story as breathing.
