tech is iterated
quality is a refinement process
writing is closer to being distilled

tons of unrefined games come out. When they're a new idea they look and feel great. These little hitches in the design that don't really remove anything are passed over by newcomers.

old games were likely to be distilled during iteration because of the tech limitations. so much content and so little quality. this is the goal I found in writing.

the first level would end up being the hardest level, and some games were downright brutal because they were aimed to satisfy long term skill growth, and a niche customer base was a given



out in the world quantity is a survival strategy with a growing audience of people not feeling satisfied, and soon the art style and repetition will feel mundane to your largest audience.  Critics can dismantle lower quality without thoughtful analysis.  The best counter strategy for quantity that slowly burns your customers turns out to be even simpler, yet novel feeling artwork, design minimalism.
