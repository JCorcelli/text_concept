ESCALATION OF JUMPING

shift jumps, initiative jumps, but people will press space or escape first


step 1 - bb bunny
if you click or press any button to move it says, ok good enough

step 2 - cage
clicking outside the cage is an auto initiative
click = you scratch the glass
hold = you scrunch up, and there's some charge meter
release 1 = bonk the glass
release 2 = dangerously, leap out of the cage

reward: scolded, held, placed back in cage, the door's still shut

Q: why'd you jump out? 

A: The motivation is exploring, and it's a couple of clicks, no big deal.  So a faster learner will do this.

Q: this starts the game in the initiative zone. so then, why is there a space button?  

A: I think that I want some way to click, direct my character without jumping, that is stealthy and... won't highlight objects floating in 2D, ie the zone.

a short time passes and the door's opened

What a tease.

Now if you stand near human it could say "mouse and shift." jumps

If you stand near things it'll say "space to zone" "zone jump is easy to aim"

If you stand near things to go inside it says "Hide (E)" Simple straightforward suggestions.

Then you go in your cage and get the "cute" choice, which will make every other choice seem weak.

all this just to JUMP[a] and yet there's not really an obstacle, so maybe jumping shouldn't be the first important lesson.
