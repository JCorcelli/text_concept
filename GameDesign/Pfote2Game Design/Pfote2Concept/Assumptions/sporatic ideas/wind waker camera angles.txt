architecture of Wind Waker

level design is a series of scenes defined by interesting things

best is 1 interesting thing
worst is 0 interesting thing
more interesting things above 1 is a puzzle

term "interesting thing" just requires a synonym to complete the scene

iconic, historic...

But ultimately it's a powerful mnemonic, an image, or value
