tons of stuff pre programmed
the human model
a lot of maths I didn't invent


I thought of an experience
I wrote a story.
I drew characters, narratives
I programmed prototype
I determined statistics to display
I attempted a second prototype
I tried to learn a premade game engine
Now I'm going way outside the box
I built a world
I wrote a second story, very different, in that world
I animated
I programmed a UI prototype, experimentation really
I brainstormed in writing, refining, extrapolating as I went

I frequently think about program methods
I frequently practice writing
I look at new methods of programming
New ideas are constant, but good ones are worth refining
