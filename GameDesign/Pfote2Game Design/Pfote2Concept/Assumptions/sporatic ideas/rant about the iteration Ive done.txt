ART?
I've been writing a huge possibility space because it seem easier for me than starting with limitation of shapes and such.

I know what has to be available to the player.  Because I don't see the development of the game as the end of the creative process, it's a huge important part, but I'm making it for someone else, in the end, and they'll do what they want in the available possibility space.
