Ludokinesis - mastery elected through play; can be defined in four steps: intro, mnemonics, self-reflection, and redundancy. Though exact measures applied may vary due to cognitive biases.


White Bunny

Step 1 This is a real white bunny. Repeat. This is a real white bunny.

Step 2 "Hi, bunny. What long ears you have, what big eyes you have." Picture that. What a soft body, you can feel the soft fur, imagine that feeling. Bunnies don't make noise, much, maybe a house rabbit does, listen to it. Trust the bunny.

Step 3 Can I get the white bunny to sit still?

Step 4 Long term goal, lap bunny. I call this lagokinesis.
