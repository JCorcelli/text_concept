So here's some more self debate about the knowledge component system.  That I expect things from it...

It will play like a very unusual RPG experience system.  You'll gather strings, stories, and info, and see them crop up again later.  It's too good to be true from the player's perspective, so maybe I should add some fake numbers to guess what bunneh's experience is at.


This is bunneh's primary character development. He can exhibit mental health, skills, and reference events.

The game won't progress if he's left alone to bunny things, a story is supposed to auto-generate and filter out mundane repetition.

There are some pretty simple facts. Bunneh isn't a baby, he already knows how to eat, he knows how to avoid getting hurt, etc. So it's like the drama of a movie, only the important bits are remembered, and the routine blends into the background.


Will it be fun or just difficult? It's a lot like telling people about a library.  The fun knowledge isn't labelled "top secret bunny stuff."  So maybe bunneh needs to decide for himself if it's fuN?

Or don't tell someone about the library. Bunneh will be perfectly content hopping around without a chance to unravel mystery and critical thought. At least that much is up to the player.

There's a potential that bunneh shows a weakness that the player can't understand.  I mentioned memory in my past posts, and mental health, there's always a chance something could cause bunneh harm, even though he knows how to avoid getting hurt.
