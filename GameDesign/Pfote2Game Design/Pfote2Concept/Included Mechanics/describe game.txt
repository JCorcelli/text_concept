As an objective outside observer I need to actually see this game with my eyes before I'll believe a word of it.


There are a list of features, and so far I've got.

1. 3D bunny
	a. stealth
	b. animated
2. very good point and click ui
3. webpage level of text ui

the text will reach wiki levels of markup, then I can start the bunny memories project.

This was the order I said I'd do things right? I'm checking.
