IDEAS WERE ENTERTAINED

	minigames - UI shifting for unique gameplay tangents
	dungeon crawling
	stuffed animals - hidden object
	needs - but I thought needs was a baby simulator, and it's really suited for "life starting" and terrible as a life lesson
	gardening

	- decided, at the very least the game needs to work first
