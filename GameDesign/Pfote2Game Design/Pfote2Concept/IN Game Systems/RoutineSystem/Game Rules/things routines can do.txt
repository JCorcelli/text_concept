inherit abstract routine

custom routine receives callbacks every time a message is sent

simple routine
	a reaction
	
	example:
	a touch can trigger an action
	an interrupt causes an action to stop so the routine may check conditions


COMPLEX ROUTINES
 WITH LOOPS AND CONDITION CHECKS
  AND GOALS
	Goal of complex routines
	get to one Action L by performing a routine sequence of other actions


	example:
	Bunny can "eat"


	bunny wants to eat
	the routine will go through every other necessary check and action in order to eat.
	Once it is possible to eat, the routine says eat.

MESSAGES IN A COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL ROUTINE
	
	example:
	Bunny 
	There are main actions like "move" "sniff" "eat" which use resources
	There are parallel actions like "smell" "see"
	There are effects like "nose wiggle" which require -nose- resource
	
	There are routines like "bunny searches"
	
	nose wiggles
	A routine of "bunny searches" begins "at 2:20pm" 
	An action "bunny moves" is called "at 2:20pm"
	An action "bunny smells roses" is called "at 2:20pm"	desire of smell
	An action "bunny sees plant pot" is called "at 2:21pm"	desire of sight
	An action "completed" is called "at 2:21pm"				because bunny is curious
	
	a routine of "bunny tastes plant" begins "at 2:22pm"
	An action "bunny goes to plant pot" is called 
	An action "completed" is called "at 2:22pm"
	An action "bunny sniffs plant leaves" is called 
	nose wiggle stops
	An action "completed" is called "at 2:22pm"
	An action "bunny eats plant" is called "at 2:23pm"
	An action "completed" is called "at 2:23pm"
	
	nose wiggles
	a routine of "bunny searches" begins, repeat

REENACTING A COMPLEX ROUTINE	
	this can be read minimally as 
		"Bunny searches. 
		Bunny smells roses. 
		Bunny sees a plant pot. 
		Bunny tastes a plant.
		
		Bunny searches."
		
	this can be displayed minimally as
		"Bunny wiggles nose. 
		Picture Roses, Plant Pot. Excited bunny.
		Bunny eats plant. 
		bunny wiggles nose."
