I should ramp up the "story" to make locations interesting. Otherwise this sounds boring.


starter house - hub world, necessary, small, easy to navigate

explorer challenges (dig tunnels, stealth, platform)
	
	unfamiliar building, big and oddly shaped - audio books
	
	grove - plentiful foods, gardens, 
	
	hedge maze - food, regrowth, landscape can change, making the escape difficult
	
	stone building - few locations to dig, lots of objects to carry or push
	
	metal maze - the heaviest things, unbeatable without exp bonus 
	
	stow away - navigate through people without getting caught or hit
	
	triggered:
	owner is missing
	
boss challenges, escape, avoid or defeat
	pyromaniac - 
	aquatic - 
	small bomberman
	
	sneaky burglar at my house
