This is content first approach. A history and individual personality list is to be written separate.


INVESTIGATION - 
if you follow a person, you get a shallow investigation of their real world locations and who meets there

THEIR HOUSE - can be similar between people...

MELDING - 
mental dive - this is a virtual world, actions will affect the owner.  It's a dream world, so it's inherently more dangerous.

dreams have the same content as above in high gear with some "distortions" of reality that ring false
