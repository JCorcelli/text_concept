LOW SHRINE

terrain

nature
odd, unnaturally perfect growth of vegetation formed as to be one with the bricks and mortar

vines strung like walkways
load-bearing trees
	
ANIMALS
animals are constantly traveling from one end to another, and you can't tell where it starts

grabby animals may carry you to a place

HIDDEN WORLD

passages between splits of heavy landscape
	like two trees
	like vines that grow to show the way
	lik a boulder that fell millions of years ago
	
technology - hints of an alien race

books - stone tablets, inedible, only gives close to the avid reader
