Following the black bunnies you can discover their secret passage mechanism.  You'll have a small dungeon to pass, and descend into the cavern below.

There are a large number of black bunnies apparent who disappear like ghosts when approached by an outsider it's hard to tell if it's illusion or something else.

When you ascend the dungeon will vanish within one night and the tunnel becomes normal.  It's impossible dig low to their cavern but an aggressive force can reveal ruins of the dungeon.  

Unearthing black bunny secrets makes you a danger to them so they never stop watching you then on.

(Fuck no I'm not doing this :P)
