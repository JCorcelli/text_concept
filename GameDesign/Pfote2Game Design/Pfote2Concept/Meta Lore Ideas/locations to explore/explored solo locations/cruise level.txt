CRUISE SHIP (it's probably too big, ought to be a LSL game)

pretty much the same setup as a few locations except it's not entirely stable
greased terrain
	1 each location rocks back and forth
	2 the place makes ocean noises
	
time limited
	it's a cruise, it's not out there forever

QUARTERS - house with tipped over furniture
GALLERY - paintings like you hang in a house
BAR
DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT (it's like a kitchen)
CLUB ROOM
EXTREME OUTDOOR SPORTS
POOL
BOILER ROOM - like factory


HIDDEN WORLD
DREAM WORLD
so basically it's the ship except the physics go completely off the rails
