ENERGY SYSTEM - PHYSICAL
I think if I want to make Bunneh a more thoughtful character I should limit his physical ability.

Stamina - heats up and depletes when overheated. Get in the shade and rest.

Heart - courage and strength. Heart protects you from getting sick. Food.

Sleep - A good nights rest recovers all.

VERBATIM

HEAT
Heat maxes out before stamina depletes.
The lost stamina is gone until he sleeps.

HEART
It's your nose, silly. Major annoyance, decisions, and danger are in conflict with your ultimate goal towards happiness.  But it's so exciting.

SKILL
Any impactful skill can come at a price.  Maybe there's something more important than your energy.

EFFECT
Running is the most expensive option.  Hyper adds double heat.

Sneaking is the easiest time to rest, some movement skills like diving require energy.

Talking would use no stamina.
