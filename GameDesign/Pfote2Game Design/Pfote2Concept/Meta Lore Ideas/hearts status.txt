Something like a health bar

white = full
brown = empty

hearts could be a "fuel"
otherwise I'd have to seriously think about love, food, energy

heart container, refillable permanent buff

extra hearts, special food, being pet


pro: adds a management challenge
con: could be very difficult to play a fun game, and gain the social manip you desire

One Heart - can't intentionally set zero hearts.
Zero Hearts - out of hearts
	On trigger become upset, flee, startled, or attack.
	
	Rests immediately in safe area.
	
Energetic - invincible, never rest, initiate play automatically

Scared - lose a heart
