SOME HYPERBOLE EXAMPLES

A giant was 7 feet tall

MUTATION: giant (increase), 7 feet
FICTION: A giant was 10 feet tall.

LIE: How tall was he? 10 feet.
......

Stoves can get hot. They can reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit maximum.

MUTATION: get hot > explode, 500 > 1000
LIE: Stoves can explode.


WHY WOULD THIS HAPPEN?

This ought to be the most common mutation.
observe fire
hear hot things explode
know a stove gets hot

DISARM THE MUTATION
learn not all things that get hot explode
practice using a stove
