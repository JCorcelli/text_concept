KNOWLEDGE OF WORLD

fact or fiction
true, false, or lie

nouns
verbs - skill or "use"
adjectives - modify, opinion
etc.

If I could I'd put it all in form, but it only makes sense to create as I go.

USE
everything you don't know about defaults to "sniff" or "observe"

when you know something you gain the "use" power, which might not work

when you know how to use something, and you brought the right tools, you can really "use" it

LOGS
with knowledge you learn opinions, possibilities, goals; and you default trust it until it's revealed to be fact or fiction.

when you learn a fact directly you can test it unless it's really bad

CREATE KNOWLEDGE
theory creates possibility, they come from 
	thoughts 
	observation
	random scraps people share
experimenting may reveal facts

DISMISS
very poorly formed knowledge, bad mutations, can be dismissed, removing any effect.  This also requires you to learn it again though.
