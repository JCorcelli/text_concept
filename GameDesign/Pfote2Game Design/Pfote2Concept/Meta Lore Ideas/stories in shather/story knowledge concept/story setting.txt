I'm writing a lot and I believe it's producing a very concrete setting

The fantasy world I'm creating so far has history. Stories are actually an integral part of the game I want to make. Revised stories, and word of mouth quickly spread and distort the truth so many optional mysteries intermingle.


Shather has a culture obsessed with freedom and equality.

1 There's a social program, to encourage people to interact.
2 There's a threat level response, based around public safety. Property is inconsequential to this response.
3 All animals have equal rights, even the wild ones.

This may be considered a serious game.  It only lacks a certain completeness, and programming, artwork skill, basically the developer is taking his time.

There's a number of dry ideas I've written to offer a game experience. Hundreds of simple skill and activity based statistics are outlined for a single player character. The small world of one bunny can be impacted and with some effort the big world explored outside can be too.

I really want to motivate the player to keep exploring.  The bunny, the player character, can learn to be calm and stay put, but I think the natural bonus from exploring will become addicting.  Like when there's something amazing to do, you can't stay put.
