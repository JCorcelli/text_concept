Reality suggests that there's something of a zero sum game between fiction and fact.

There are extra rules to be considered for this game, but I think the basic ideas is 


WHAT'S A LIE?


some ground rules for my depiction of lies
REAL SOURCE
1 There must be a source material to lie about.
2 The whole source is available (or it's really not known)

STORY MUTATION
3 A great number of distorted spellings or sentences don't change the meaning.  Although this may cause a mutation.
4 Mutations are only lies if the full meaning changes, which suggests,
5 there can be more than one truth.

SOURCE, MULTIPLE PEOPLE
6 One perspective of an event with multiple witnesses is incomplete.
7 A scenario where every equivalent perspective hasn't mutated is a source.


SOURCE, FACT STATMENT
8 Suggesting factual contents but depicting false accounts is a lie, and it's libel.

SOURCE, DEAD (ZERO SUM)
9 If the source is lost, then it's a dead source.  Altering the original source kills it.

SOURCE, EXPERIMENTATION
10 A source can be created by experimentation on knowledge, making all false assertions a lie.
