"The Bright Fox" written by "Canry Waffle"

There is an old tale. It's a world manifested at night under old furniture. A light turns bright, and magic happens.

I once met a fox who smoked a pipe and told me this tale.


Out from the glowing light on a dim night are wingless faeries without flight.  
They look almost like elves, or ducks, but that doesn't quite fit, what do they call them selves? Trucks?
They are a slow, bumbling, and carefree bunch.  After a quick looky loo eating crumbs they sneak off quick back under a furniture hunch.

I've gone with them. Let me tell you. Their world is true, as real as you.

The fox piped.

There are glowing rivers that make melting sounds.  Cunning birds, plain, but silent with strangers watching them all around.

Small bushes breach the tall grass.  Flowers that illuminate a shaded lee.  Upon what would only be shadow during the day cast by the trunk of a big lavender tree.

There the slow moving spirit that stays low to the ground.  The popin that made the place known.  Though they present themselves to those they deem fit, their reason isn't spoken.  They make no sound.

The fox seemed to get tired and continued.

I saw them gather water one clout at a time.  They dropped it on the dirt for a solitary seed, and it sprouts.  I felt ashamed for wanting to eat a duck, and now it offered me a fruit of its own and said "take it with you, you dumb cluck".

I said "I am a fox and can't eat that, please watch your mouth or I may get mad."

I was forced to carry the fruit to the other side of the land. There I escaped that wretch of a sapling and lived happily ever after.

I noticed the fox was done and I asked about what he was handed.

"Oh that thing, I had to bury each seed.  With it I had the premonition of a giant wooden tree.  They must have grown by now but I can't remember where that was."
