"BBBunny an Endangered Species" by Emilie Rosat. (a Shather borne teacher)

The population of black bunnies is rather low, and endemic to Shather. This puts them on the protected species list.

Using research submitted before, we can determine that damage to their habitat poses a threat to their survival. 

Nature preserves are necessary to protect our wildlife.
