"Black bunnies, the most unusual coven" by Harper William. (a human interloper)

Black bunnies are capable of navigating long distances, back and forth repeated. It's evident because electronically tagged 'bunnies' are known to travel farther and more accurately than any other recorded lagomorpha.

Not only that, but the entire group of black bunnies tagged in one area remain, as a coven. For months now they are taking the same routes, and digging through the same tunnels. They are by far the most unusual animal of habit.

Their reproduction habits remain unknown. Due to deep tunnels it's possible they select one leader and follow.  At times they group in one place, few don't make it to these 'meetings'.  Unfortunately no footage is made, because all attempts at exodermal chipping fail.

The secrecy and group mind of the "black bunny" certainly solidifies the notion of a coven.
