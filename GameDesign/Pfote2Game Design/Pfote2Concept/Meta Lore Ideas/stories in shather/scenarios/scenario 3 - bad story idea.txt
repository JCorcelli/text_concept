SCENARIO: MUTATION ISSUE

You follow something.

Something is talking to itself.  It's a light long tailed winged thing.
"I came way out here just to practice this. Gust potion."
It poured the potion onto the ground all in one go. There's a great burst of air, like someone popped a balloon.
But what was that? You think.
"Too much, and I have to go back to Smokey to purchase it."
You could follow, but it's a little easier to learn things looking around.
[sometime after]
You hear conversations between people and follow the trails they leave.  After a quick search online... You encounter Smokey, a salesman with a cart at the central market.
He doesn't offer you much advice, but he'll sell some of what he calls gust weed. Gust sounds awesome, among the other useless sounding things you don't recognize.
Where does he get it? 

You can follow him.  If you could read his mind, hmm. Interrogate him.

Looking angry you force the idea of gust weed into his mind. He looks at you for a second, and with puzzlement. He gives you a little piece of bread and smiles. "Do you want to come with me little one?"

You could jump in his wagon stall now. But I don't think that was the goal.

After a minute, he reaches down and lifts you onto the stall, currently open.  Actually, now you get a good whiff. You could eat a lot of what's in front of you, it's your good old friend, hay.  You decide you like Smokey.

You snuggle in and, next moment you're back home, in the house.  That's a good... 10 minutes of frolicking, and it left you with a mystery of the gust potion.

[the next day]
Goal: find Snorky and learn about this guts thing. Don't get caught.
So you go out. You're going to ... aah! This isn't right, the goal you had yesterday, you forgot.
