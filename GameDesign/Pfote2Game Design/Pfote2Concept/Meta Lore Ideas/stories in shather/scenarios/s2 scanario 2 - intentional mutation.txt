intentional mutation examples ala "intentional vs. random mutation"

intentional (preprogrammed or otherwise)
user manipulation is a behavior that needs to be exhibited through action


OMITTER
someone just doesn't want to talk about dogs
"dogs are cool"

mutation
"animals are cool"
"" no comment

lie
"I haven't seen any dogs"

OFFENDER
someone really hates dogs

only stores phrases he likes and destroys the others
eg "dead dog"

any mention of dogs makes them highly interrogative until they hear
	"I haven't"
	or one of their stored phrases are used.
	
the phrase "love dogs" makes them start griefing

saying "baby" can be mistaken as an offense and the offender is stalked until they return home where someone searches for signs of a dog approximately 30 minutes, no additional action necessary. It's pretty scary.
