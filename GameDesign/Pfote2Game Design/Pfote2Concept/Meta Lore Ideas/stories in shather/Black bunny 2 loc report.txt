"BBBunny Tunnel Science" by Emilie Rosat. (a Shather borne teacher)

After research on the tunnels reported to stretch miles was made, there is nothing unusual about black bunnies (visit science_sha.org for detail).

The miles of tunnels are actually multiple shallow tunnels. Probably existing for years. 

What a normal bunny can accomplish without tools and with their small bodies is nothing spectacular.  They simply adopt tunnels dug by previous generations.
