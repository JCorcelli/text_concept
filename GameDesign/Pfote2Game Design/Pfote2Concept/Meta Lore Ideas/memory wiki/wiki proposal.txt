a word script knows what's where in basic text, at any point it can be used to open up a memory page. The marked text shouldn't get in the way, can't be rich text.

Wiki.WordLink
1 main use
	on hover ,
	o	calculate text cursor position
	o	track word (visible in text)
		

2 on click (in or outside wiki) do a memory search
	I know what was clicked!
	
	{special} word in text
		a prefab
		
		image idk.
	
	a link?
	
3 knowledge
	"Bunneh" is a word
	"Jerri" is a word
	and they get their own pages, of course "Bunneh" is the main character, so info on him will be slightly skewed
	
DESIGN
memory wiki

make UI
	open/close
	history ascending from right
	recent at top
stream a page related to "word"

now on click I stream a page. was that named page linker?


USERS

	list user names, search to find all info
	or rather find a user name, search
	
	people will say each other's names all the time. How does it associate the word with the name? It's fucking difficult.
