assumptions
	you know the basics mechanic,
	signal, move, rotate camera
	
step 1
find laptop
use the laptop
there's a sim date app
set the date scene on the laptop : location, day of the week, event; subtle hints 
start a date
pick a mode

step 2
you're informed that the date requires you to enter continue on the app, and a real-time test is necessary to graduate.

choose: enter the dialogue display
here you should be able to examine jerri
some basic stats from the date app are visible for convenience

step 3
go through the steps of a date with dialogue window or by using the laptop app

interest	the topic
		
	jerri will begin a dialogue
	her choice is a semi random topic
	also non-verbal behavior
	amusement
	bunneh
	say weird things
	
generous	
	information of the topic
	escalating with touching
	
greed		test
	something in the room
	ignore for a minute
	hold
	demand kiss
	let you rest on her
	
guilt		just an extra step
	good
	she'll pet you
	extend the greed
	
	bad
	send you to cage
	put you in cage
	
there must be a program that offers options every time jerri makes her move. They're intended to be fun and no major difference in outcome yet.

tip:  you can skip this and take the test	

step 4
take the test

it is very similar to the previous, and jerri makes her moves without warning, when you aren't even near the laptop.  This adds a few issues.

interest
	you can leave and she'll give up early
generous
	during escalation she can get really annoyed if you don't pay attention
greed
	she'll get up just to grab you
guilt
	
step 5
something something, relationship status?

You get a real world taste of the obscure relationship status in Shather.

Acquaintance - you know eachother
	before the dating app
	
Friend - you have a bond
	any use of dating app
	jerri is nicer?
	
Date - you've gone out
	you take the test
	jerri is asking to play the app more
	
Together - now you're basically doomed
	you pass the test perfectly
	jerri starts the app and forces you to play with her!
	
step 5*
sim dating app ending (jerri in the lead)

interest
	explains that she used the app
generous
	pets nose repeatedly
test
	takes out a (fake) gun
	the room becomes a heart shooting game (like the pew pew choice)
guilt
	"You're so cute bunneh. By the way, we're moving. I hope you're comfortable in the new flat."
	something to that effect
