ESCALATION OF MECHANIC

most important lesson is to signal
zone empowers signal
should I add zone shortcuts? space+key, so you don't enter zone.


level 1 - signal

see Jerri(A)
click outside cage flags tutorial, informs you "press space"
space notably highlights
click signals Jerri to open cage with frantic door scratching

no obstacle, but new player experimentation is key.

space, click (properly taunt your owner)

Also there's a more expert, but dangerous escape method. Jump out.

So that's two ways to get out of the cage so far, right at the start.

decisions you make trivialize the challenge of the cage because... that's a lot of choice


and there's constant alternative options
use
jump
running
going in shadows
etc
