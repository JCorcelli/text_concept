this is dialogue
	starting a dating sim game
		game is dynamic boxes
		
	jerri talking to bunneh
	bunneh choosing a response
		options are dynamic box 
		sub options open prompt
concept: 
1 jerri continues to the next step when you choose to on the app
2 options will test the ui, but only one step of response (for simplicity), and escape to the options again.

shit I started writing pseudocode. it's just for the computer then.
