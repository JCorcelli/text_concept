--- JUMP
goats are jumping up a difficult ramp, one falls, and you can find it lying down.

--- HIDING SPOT
there's a good spot to dig.  There's a boar, and it digs, plants bombs, and runs out yelling fire in the hole! before there's bang and the earth above there sinks.

--- THROW

boars are also wrestling

--- RED BIRD

noisy freaking birds you can't get anywhere near, dumping red paint cans.

--- WATER

a cat won't attack but if you walk near the bushes it gives you a shout.  It's usually near water.

--- R. FORMULA
There's a formula, randomly grants heal, speed, or illusion, but should be the same each time.
