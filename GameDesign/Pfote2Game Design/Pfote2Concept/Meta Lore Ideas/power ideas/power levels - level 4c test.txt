POWER LEVELS - LEVEL 4c REST

challenge
goal:

1 test, and twist

	so far the place is a ton of grease based puzzles, and the information you gathered is entirely on that
	
	a few things that could ease the process: 
	knowing the PN
	finishing the lab
	learning grease locations
	completing sports
	
2 there is some penalty for failing
	setback
	getting caught
	losing a heart - sends you back home 
	
3 there are benefits	
	lab checkpoint
	reversion / eraser spray
	
	extreme sports team can bring munitions
	knowledge of mutations

The final area...
FORT CONSTRUCTION
test your ingenuity, as simple as building a trampoline and a soft ground to scale an enormous barrier.

you still face the dangers as before, with travel involved.

attempts to build a permanent base at the foot of the steep cliff are met with resistance from hunkies.

FAKEOUT
after getting on the barrier the animals are excited, but you see there's more.  The usual fanfare is a fakeout.

RESTRICTING MATERIALS
Unless you deploy a base and transport them, then materials won't reach here.  This makes the next part take a while.

AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIER'S CHALLENGE

can't dig
pits
moving platforms
cliffs
slippery sloping terrain
portals

it doesn't have to fully make sense anymore. This is what's over that barrier you climbed, the next level of danger, and it's evident that you're going to run out of eraser spray and trees in no time flat.

as you move along you can make shortcuts, but your stamina requires you to return and exit the same way.

It's expected you know all the core mechanics of the game, and with the knowledge of grease this barrier can be a fun exploit.


DREAM
There's a gate keeper, and evil spirits with the power to distort reality.

Small gate keepers prevent you from escape, and you fight them.

A bana distracts you. You can't change your fate without heart.
