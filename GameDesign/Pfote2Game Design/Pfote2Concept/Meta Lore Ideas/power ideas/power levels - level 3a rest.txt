BANA - Flag

More secretive.

Dogs line up and carry a leash around.  This introduces the effect of bana.

BANA - Ball
A dog's obsessing over a ball. If it rolls he thinks he'll grab it.

There's a squirrel. Similar.

RED DOG
A dog sniffs you. Gets some paint.

If you stand still it paints your nose red, imitating the red bird.

SHOUTING DOG

There are dogs yelling.

SHROOM
Bunnies are running around really fast in a field of shroom.
