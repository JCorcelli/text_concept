POWER LEVELS - LEVEL 1 REST

goal: 
1 there are friendly and helpful animals? 
2 environment cues

from the start it should be easy to find a not so subtle tutorial
 you'll see an odd path.  There should be a nice landmark. if you run straight or stay in the grass you don't get bothered by one bird before entering this area.
 
 Using observe might give you some hints.
 
If you go there...

--- JUMP
There are a few easy jumps. Observing the animals will halt them, and they'll describe what they do, and "experience."

A fox is practicing a running long jump from one side of a depression to another.

Fish are practicing jumps in their pond.

Bigger animals probably jump around too.

There are frogs jumping on lily pads.

I bet a bunny would feel like jumping.

--- HIDING SPOT

There are good hiding spots. Things are jumping between hiding spots. 

It looks like one laughing animal is in the lead, diving to hide.

A bird stands vigilantly saying "I see you" 

Another who chases says "I caught you."

--- THROW

There's a dirt wall, some animals of varying ability are throwing mud clods that splat the wall.

Oh if you hit any of them with a mud clod they scold you and ask for a squawking bird to shoo you away. "Do that outside here and you might see stars you rambunctious otter." They seem to have misidentified you.

--- RED BIRD

Tough birds that won't go away. They keep stopping you near their tree and pointing, and some wing gesture.  There's a picture of a bleeding heart on the tree.  

Wait long and they color you red.

--- WATER

Some water. It's too scary. If you fall in you immediately get out though you lose a heart.
