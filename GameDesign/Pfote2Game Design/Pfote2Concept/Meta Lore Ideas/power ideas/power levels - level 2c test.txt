Introduction to risks and danger

goal: 

The state of the untamed wild is an absolute danger.

1 Take an element from this chapter and add a twist
	pigs - can be aggressive, trying to pound some shape out of the terrain to gather bomb ingredients
		can alter their bomb harvest later
		
	talking - talk to the pigs and they will bring you bombs until you accomplish an objective

	
There's birds and cats. Giant hollows.
There's the puzzle, and ...

Say you need to play bombs at points.

Point 1
Obstacle course would force you to carry a bomb, limiting you item choice.
A cat or bird can interrupt, getting scared you drop the bomb.

Point 2
A group of pigs are digging. You scare them away first, or they'll deflect the bomb.

Point 3
Some trees need to be felled, and it requires a long range toss.

Point 4
The pigs dug a hollow, but due to a cave-in they can't reach the stockpile that'll blow a huge crater. Either bury it or use it.

#Escalation - Angry birds
You're not making any friends with birds lately. This type of bird is carrying a bomb.

DREAM
You dream of a quaking land with falling rocks and trees. Birds that grab you, carrying you the way you run.

SECRET
With some observation you see other plants like the motherbomb. Fire grass.  It's very effective at taking down trees. There's underground fire grass as well as aquifers, one to light hollows on fire, and another to turn it off.  The purpose?  The animals should be scared of fire right?

Dream
like the prevous dream, but the underground has floods and rivers of fire.
