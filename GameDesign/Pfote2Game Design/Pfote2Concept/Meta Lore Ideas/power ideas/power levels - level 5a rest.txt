OBSERVATORY
Some empty-headed scholars discusses the challenge of the world in scope. They only know what they've seen.

SCHOOL
Test and train the basic skill, through narrow experience.

The place is reset, and there's no excessive course.

THREAT RESPONSE
If you're a dangerous animal then you're not allowed anywhere near the rest areas.

UNFAIRNESS
ANIMAL
Animals are mischievous.

You get attacked for no reason, or dispute territory - hearts will allow you to last longer.

FOOD
Food isn't wild, it takes a while to gather even with basic inventory.

SUCCESS
Benefits of an area are restricted to the area - go back to get it.

DREAM
Simply reaching this area enables the nightmare.

Using the schools give you a guaranteed nightmare.

If you use your dream world to train, the training is a nightmarish hellscape.  If you encounter a demonic artifact, similar.
