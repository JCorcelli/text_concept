POWER LEVELS - LEVEL 1b ALT.

some ideas of "what if" the level had to change in response to Bunneh...

Change in reality, or a dream state.
What if monsters were real? 
	Then they'd be walking around outside and the animals would be hiding in houses.

Something Bunneh did.
What if Bunneh were high threat (killer)? \
	The instant you're seen, 2-5 minutes after in that area, there'd be a search, detain squad.  Also 

	the front of Jerri's house would have a cyborg monitoring.
	
If bunneh left the wrong way, there'd be a fence, garden, and paved ground.  On the other side of that fence is a potential area.

What if you visited that area first?
	Could make it really awkward. Gate it with high visibility and key item flags.
	
	Somehow, grinding and escaping this way could be some expert move.  
	
	Obviously if you lose your hearts you get sent home.  The question is what is worth all this effort? It could just be a dead end.
	
A wide open area can't be filled in with content. Is repetition ok?

Maybe. In the starting area the same type of puzzle can be placed everywhere.
The issue is secret areas. They'd be, not so secret.  So at best they'll grant uncommon rewards, like you get from every place there.
