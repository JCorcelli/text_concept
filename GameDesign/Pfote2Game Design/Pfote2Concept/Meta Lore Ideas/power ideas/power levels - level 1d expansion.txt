Think more like if there's a question after the puzzle. Like, why are the animals all here? Here's the answer.

DREAM ANSWER (MOUNTAIN): 
There's some big cheese. A literal block of cheese is in the way of a major exit. 

You can eat it and end the dream now.

If you go in there's a mountain of cheese, and the cheese talks.  You can eat one, and hear screams of agony.


REALITY ANSWER 1: THERE'S A RATHER LARGE MOUNTAIN.

Getting into the mountain requires some precision demolition, hiding spot maneuvers, or platforming. Being observant, you will consider all these things.

By the way, the decision matters.

demolition flaws will probably cause some environmental disasters

bad hidden maneuvers require a supplementary platforming maneuver.

platforming obviously means you'll fall

etc.


It should actually be child's play to walk out, go to the mountain, no artificial barrier to entry.  Because the next part is where the voluntary challenge starts.


MYSTERY
there's no obvious way people would visit without a road.  This could raise questions.
1 gated region
2 the game is an obvious fantasy world, and this is the tipping point, once you get over that mountain and past the gate... boom
