PN
respond if you attempt to leave with grease, otherwise they'll sit idly

THREAT RESPONSE
information about your threat level and identifying behavior is available here.  The actions expected of the citizens and mercenary squads is mentioned.


GREASE - METAMORPHOSIS
the grease family of foods is at a stage II metamorphic hazard, uncanny.

There's a research desk with samples you can't access.  The clerk has more information available.

There is one grease available that the animals are playing with.

Slip - 
(AaBb)
See a grease. Get interrupted by a terrain effect. Solve the problem. Get the grease.

When you walk on slip terrain you slide straight to the other side and off. All around the slip grease has been altered, and although the effect caused by new animals is temporary it still gets in the way.

You can puzzle through it.

WACKY TERRAIN, CRAZY ANIMALS
They're less talkative if they're busy.  Bumping into one is very annoying.

(AaCc)
Each grease effect has a solution and is destroyed if another effect is transposed.

There's a grease removal formula at your disposal.  Or you can ask the PN to help.
