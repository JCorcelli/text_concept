POWER LEVELS - LEVEL 4d FINISH


You reach the barrier's end

There's another lab run by birds and for finishing you're given a white bana.  It lets you walk through the outside without increasing threat, and removes threat mobs.

The animals are happy.

You find a soft patch of dirt-morphic metal and dig in.

Q1 : why don't grease appear elsewhere?
ANSWER
PN - peace nominal
HOW THINGS STAY NORMAL
Human patrols are removing grease impact outside this secluded area.  They spray the area with reversion formulae.


Q2 : WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE?

ANSWER : YOU WANT A BIGGER CHALLENGE

There are multiple areas beyond requiring skills... in development.

To access one requires you meet a simple challenge. The challenge grows even deeper in.

Through wit or willpower, you can finish all of them.  But it's not supposed to be easy.

Not even the inhabitants are fully able to help.  There could be nobody.

Q3 : WHO DO YOU BLAME?
Well the Hunkies might have to do with it.  THey manned the forts, preventing entrance to the barrier.

Although they'll offer to help. It's unclear.
