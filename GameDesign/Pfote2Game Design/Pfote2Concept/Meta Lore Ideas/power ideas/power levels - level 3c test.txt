design goal
1 test the knowledge of the area
2 twist
	talking birds

There's a chasm so wide there are clouds.  Inside is a squirrel village.

TALKING BIRDS
For some reason birds are guarding the first gate.  But they're easy to get past while they talk to eachother.

GENERAL POPULACE
Squirrels.  They have small hiding spots, so you don't have the same hidden movement options. Luckily they aren't big on threat.

Your challenge inside are numerous key banas and getting chased while carrying them.

Repeatedly, squirrels patrol, or birds are standing guard.  You simply need to notice them and get around.

Extra
1 If you attack with a sword the squirrels retaliate.  Of course a killer bunny has worse to worry about.

2 If you lead wild bunnies into the squirrels they'll be distracted a short while.


DREAM
There's a cloud kingdom. Clouds get in your way.
Various swords threaten you.

It's mostly a fight to defeat the cloud king.
