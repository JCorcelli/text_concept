TERRAIN SEGMENTS
HIDDEN

mist flowers - ornamental flowers cause you to be hidden
	cue some stealth notice because I don't think this will be obvious.
	
hollow trunks - trees that can be traveled through like hiding spots
	
premade tunnels - dangerous. dug by roots and bunnies, work as points of fast traversal

big leaves - are a natural cover system if you just walk under them you've not visible

grass - edible and bunnies chew on some just to keep going. tall grass is good for hiding.
