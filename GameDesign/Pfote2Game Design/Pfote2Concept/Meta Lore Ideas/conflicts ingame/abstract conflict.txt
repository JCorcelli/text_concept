internal conflict probably
bunneh's spoiled
he can do anything
he doesn't think he's free, and sees how his behavior is monitored

civilization is a concept that human culture is above nature
freedom in a concept that you aren't bound, but to maintain civilization there's no way
equality means no difference, and that's bullshit

so here, nature itself has been cultivated to gift power. freedom is easy come, easy go.
the place bunneh lives in has culture that protects and encourages him to exploit nature.
identity is neutral. his will, through meaningful actions, he changes everything.
