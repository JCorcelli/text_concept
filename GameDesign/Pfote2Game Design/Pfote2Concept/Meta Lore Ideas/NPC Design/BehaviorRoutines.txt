ROUTINES

the NPC's direction indicator points where it's intent on going.

Movement / Traversal by player is handled by selecting a location.

Stealth is a system of safe areas and outside those, LOS detection towards enemies.
	Hiding is an NPC function, checking for safe areas within LOS if he's tired. Remaining hidden while in safe areas is a given, although sometimes rules can be broken.
	
Search is an NPC function, checking for targets within LOS, and random positions to move to in-range. When seeking a specific {var}, the search is always on.

Idle is lack of intentional movement. Player idleness doesn't predict NPC behavior.

Sleep is predicated by absolute safety while tired.
Eat is predicated by a presence of food while hungry.
Play is predicated by total energy.
Seeking {var} is predicated by a desire to have {var}. It can override reason.
