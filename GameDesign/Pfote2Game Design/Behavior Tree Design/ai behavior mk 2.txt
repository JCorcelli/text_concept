basic ideas
1
a behavior can be turned on / off
2
a ruling behavior is run, calling all others, and it can turn them off at will

vocab
1 behavior - each trunk of a tree is a "behavior"
2 Action - A sequence of small scripts in quick succession (low response)

vocab, behavior type
1 Priority - A quick response, variable dependent state. 
2 Routine - A routine behavior is set to check a timer. 
3 Activity - A group of actions with an endpoint goal.
4 Elegance - Actions ready to escape activities.

Really I want it to play like a program.
I think true to realism would be modulated variable for activity and alertness
		
thought delay - idleness
reaction delay - if something is happening, how long to notice
action speed multi - base action speed shift, for animations and delays
 
list of activities
current activity


Priorities would be always on, responding to stimuli. Modulating based on activity.

Example: see smoke, you stop all activity and look

Routines play out, and end activities that pass their sentry value.

Actions are played directly.  An action should finish before a new action.
