Reconsidering the Game Engine

Behavior Tree:
	The main behavior is driven by the game engine
	It is enabling and disabling sub behaviors (The routines)
	It is altering resource states
	
Routines:
	disable /activate tasks when resource states are correct
	
	
Parallel Composite: all physics, all distance checks
Decorator / Semaphore: all stats, all flags

Selector / Routines: tasks that are active may be additional behavior selectors
