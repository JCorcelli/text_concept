Story:
start -> see 3d room, bunny thinks "Time limit"

learn to dig -> "I don't have anyone to teach me the rules to this game" bunneh needs to make several trips and learn 

beginner -> 1 minute to dig first tunnel
skilled -> uncover one tunnel "complete a dig with one move"
expert -> uncover 3 tunnels "dig very fast now"
legendary -> uncover a ruin


After expert ->  , reveal game

simplifying -> see 2d rooms (squares), 2d bunny, tunnels with a 2d signature, animation


you can zoom into a room or simply traverse it.
future gimiks? rooms close to bedroom, rooms near outside, 
rooms with undiscovered gimiks can be highlighted - need to be examined

Bunneh finds a treasure room "IOU" Bunneh noms it.


final question: does this sound fun? ... not quite
