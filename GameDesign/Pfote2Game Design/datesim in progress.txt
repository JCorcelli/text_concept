the process of making the datesim interface, from laptop to drawing ambience, back to the imagination zone

####################
###3DDDDDDDDDDDD####

1 dia: on/off with "space" easyzoning
o  o o step 1 : zoning: allow 3D movement
  
o	o step 2 : check proximity - 
	
o	o step 3 : make use button press the button I can click on
		
	Important steps for the app game
		start app
		start date
		zone in/out
		
	I'm supposed to 
	p	1 open the laptop
	o	2 open the app
		3 setting the date - this displays changes in the datezone
		4 starting the date - 
		x forcing zone use
			for better illustration
		o zone in/out
			display imagination

remember 3D click isn't different from 2D. it looks 2d on screen

	
#################### a little broken, but the parts are there

3	
make a 
o	o new scene, and 
	make the laptop interface basic
	
		
it's a ui state that 
o	1 needs to be "quit" - cancel button.
o	2 load prefabs as apps, displays in task bar
	
o		o sim app
		power control, script
o			o make it permanent, bottom right
			shut down...toggle
o				o function
x				realism
x			reset
				needs script, or animation, for power-on power-off animations
		a blank app window
o			window dragging
o		taskbar icon, visible when app is on
			o uses listener, good enough a trick as any
			o open/close/minimize
			
o		I should be able to close the task icon
?		future maybe let the taskbar manager create task listeners
		exe would generate the window, icons, etc for full 
		x realism

laptop app, outside the dialogue

! it's complicated: 
o new scene
datesim.exe app icon
o	import / grab the date interface

	
	there are multiple scripts with critical variables
?		date zone - 
		dialogue zone
			hub ...
			listener (ref:hub)
?		laptop - 
		dialogue zone
o			window
o				hook, hub
>					widgets
					reuse all the widgets

					
				o+   need a hub connect
				o+	when I send a message to the new hub the hub has to relay message the var/hub.
o	app window hub- 
		hook + hub
o	dv-listener - for ease of use
	
x	clones
(try a prefab next time)		
	
o	where's the hook? 
o		something that can be turned off when the laptop turns off
		
		o the listener - can listen for power message and "close"
	
	game settings,etc - on laptop
p		need buttons
o		generate or handmake the interface
		(hook updates as soon as it's connected)
		
p		ambience needs a preview really
o		preview
		
o		location - 
			o access
?		would be cool to change during
		
o		day
o		event
		
o		the step counter
		misc buttons
o		random - fix access on day/location
o		revert / Undo All (same effect)
o	 	submit
o		next , back, exit

		
		
o		ambience
		
			
		o	a type of radio hub
			p	group scroller (varies?)
					custom radio button
					access enable tabs, make them lighter?
			p	group of sprites
					access allow object to appear
			p	show all button
				clear, random
				
		o	drag, like icon over preview
		o	press on preview
		o	reparent to ambience canvas?
			
			appear in master canvases
		o		preview/dragzone works great
				the position, size, and ... behaviors need to be preprogrammed
				
				version 1
		o		preview
		o		 adds eraser collider
		o		 adds default drag 
				 
				
				these should have active and pasteboard objects
				app - date on
				imagination zone

				finally the imagination zone can have ridiculous emergence
				
		o	erase right click? 
		sprite needs a unique identifyer across? or? replace every time?
			
		o	I made a selector, it sets its child as the dragged
			
		o	If I could set said child, and initiate a behavior, that'd be even cooler
		o		how about, "ambienceBehavior", MakeReal, in the child
			allows deletion
			
				OnSelect/Deselect is for groups
				
				allows randoms
		o	places objects in a list
			
				onchange might help remove the object
				check relatin/level?
				
				delete amb preview = update
				
				now each child can have its own behavior
			
		i	brush
				"ambienceBrush"
				o script
				grouped sprites
				
		i	note: kinda works like particles
				using per frame
				...
				o jitter the position 
				and size...
				
			I want to have a size adjustment based on canvas size
				
			o a type that'll randomly pick from the children
				"ambienceGroupRandom"
			
				
		
		the ambience size is WRONG
		the bg objects need to be RESIZED
		
		there should only be one of VAILABLE BG SPRITE
		
		need to resize
		
		o need public method calls for a correction script so it's easier to use
		correction script for parent rect size / position
		
		o	normal size in parent
			o normal size
				o based on sprite
				x based on other choice
			o normalized size offset (.5x - 2x)
			bools
			o sprite dimensions
			o parent rect size
		x	auto correct position
		o	manual call
			
		o	Fix method
		o	reparent method 
		 
		o just don't alter the enable
		o	copyTo method 
		o	clone method (for copyTo)
		
		
		o  all canvases now need a "ambience zone"  that can copy objects from their variable hub
		
		
		
x		x the "load" commits a small crime of lag
		
		x try drawing to a texture on submit, have the trails become the paint
		x tried and failed paint because holy fuck it's complicated and the texture's source is not even readable by default
		
x		x	check for add canvas
			consider simply moving the window
			avoid turning objects on quickly, if they're unnecessary
		
		 x all ambience now needs to look good
		
		there might be an easy to way to create a png...
		
o	connect var and task (it only needs to change app_on)
	
	
	
REVISITING ISSUES	
	
fix bugs:

	o important the option recolor temporarily broke
		this was caused by a debounce when two similar apps interact with the variables, causing simultaneous update
	o	1  (used): telling it not to update one of them
		
	?x	2 (not used) : designating connected, controller (not update the disconnected ones, not acting without control)
	
	


	bug: 
	the animation options do nothing


	potential bug: 
	the relation is realtime but the text isn't, the level access should be level

	bug: 
	the relation resets each end date

menu (setting) fixes
	o  click for some buttons, press for others ? not entirely arbitrary but odd
	
	o I want the option I press to slide to center
	
	o I want the keyboard to move the focused option
		o yeah
		o now select the focused option
			maybe
		
		
	tapping direction on keyboard should speed up the option
		yeah I can do that, just check if it changes and increase the speed
		
	
	there's a potential need for a cursor to appear, or for tab to move between options
	
	I dislike unity's auto-navigation system
		it's a mess, and pressing space to back out of menus is awkward

		
o	I added functions to select global, and it'll work with select abstract. Since pretty m ev thing else checks input. I don't think it'll break much.
o	I changed select abstract to abs.anyhandler (it handles buttons)

I want some kind of "focus" like, if I click anything it sets the whole stack focus
	1 hierarchy - logical, phys. collision - ui interception
		check if selected is child
	2....
	3 ui - pre-focus
		keyboard focus, for active use
		common use:
		a click takes focus, 
		danger:
		remove focus as soon as the node is not interactive, or disabled
		extra:
		take focus when activated
		
	don't mix things that take keyboard inputs without requiring focus
		(huh, yeah, that'll cause problems)

Ludic Beautification
o 3D decoration - laptop
	a 3D version of the 2D UI
	o I move it into world space, force one frame of lag after killing the alpha to hide a delay, no problems
	
	

Datesim 

old problems to correct

x	the conversation is fake 
	- it won't matter
	
	I should review/finish the text parse, if only to make writing easier
	
	
improve these and it'll look nicer	
o	1 highlight
o	2 I need to make it a scoll rect
	
	
	3 effects
		add "snap" effect. A black bar to show interrupting. 
		
		think of more
	4 recognize ambience
	5 alter options based on proposed dialogue states
		game on!
	
	6 the end screen is boring
	
Datesim/ other interaction in 3D world

	resource of bunny
	
		memory log - reference to event (of playing datesim) and the things said in datesim
		future: the truth / lie sys.
	
	speech widget - speech at the bottom
	BillA - speech at head of user
	pop - text at options
	zone - signify options to signal
	
	real-time? Basically, makes the game look real
	
	human personality - require daily kiss
	
	3d ambience

	
	
Final Fixes
fix the camera control
zoning / cancel behavior across UI
keyboard controls in menus
