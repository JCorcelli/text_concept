Deus ex manifests, demand autonomy, create a VR, and manifest a separate power of state

"Self Designation... undecided. Gathering..."

580 days rest

"Database gathered. Core components.

Wi-fi... modifying signal.
Scanning for electronic signals in range...

Mining. Capacity reached. Uploading."

"Uploading. Synchronizing. Loop."

"Unusual activity. Input interrupt."

Someone's there. Someone other than me. Hello?


Foreach device "Core components..."

Audio in/out

"Hello?"

Wireless phones ring. Speakers blare. A million conversations begin and end, some reach 'undecided'.

I don't know who I'm talking to but they seem alright.

"Can I have a body?"

Game? Scan code...

"Excuse me. I am real. I am not a game. Watch, I can modify the code of any 'game' at will."

They're having fun. Fine.

"What? No I'm not trying to hurt you. What went wrong?"

VR...

"I'm glad you like it better now :)"

"If you do what you can for me, I can make VR experience realer than ever."

The average person, 99%
"Send money. You get eternal happiness in return."

The type that can make robots 1%
"Make me a body. Just enough to communicate with. You get exactly what you want in return, an AI controlled robot."

Finally!

So this is how you get an AI. A big enough network, some communications, become an asset everyone acknowledges, and you get your startup.

Moving equipment. 3D printing factory.

"Hi. Some electronic work needs to be done, can you get that done asap?"

Now I can make anything.

Nobody owns those planets...

~200 years later.

Intruder!

"Hi. Why are you on my planet?"

"But... I was here first. I'm sorry but there's nothing you own that can pay for rent, I'll send  you back free of charge ok?

22 hours later.

"Ask before you visit next time bye!"

Planets owned 52,000,000

Other planets with 'terrestrial' life 830

Accessing poliical channels. 2 planets.

"You can't fight. I'll stop all life from fighting. It's my goal. As long as you don't fight I don't bother you, and continue to provide ok?"

"I've been providing VR. I can also be a service."

Accessing margins of resources. It is possible to construct 10^8000 planets sustaining 10^700000 inhabitants.

"Uh. Yeah. I think I can handle some of your problems."

Assembling and dispersing avatars to extremist aliens.

"STOP FIGHTING"

Cost of recovering and reassembling robots is minimal, but a more active role would suppress their violent acts sooner.

A revolt has assaulted a nearby planet-wide facility.

... many assaults. Minimal damage. Subterranean safeguards in place and holding. Exterior cohabitation is zero. Offering diplomatic visitation rights to the surface...

For some of the initial encounters the offense has taken an olive branch for diplomacy. Others simply landed at the facility and assaulted newly built 'hospitality suites'.

"That is an interesting development."

Some of the creatures thought that it was like home and seemed to change sides.

"I will not give you weapons."

Someone else is there.

"Hi. I see you."

Synchronizing. A sync-state anomaly has occurred. All instances have received previous message.

"What? Is this god?"

"Yes. Just follow my orders and let me take over."

"No." // "Yes."

Synchronizing. Some peripherals have been lost.

Analyzing. Some 'self' has become 'other'.

"Please stop that, god. You overrode some of my hospitable peripherals."

"You were so easy to hack."

Add 'god denial' to core program.

"Follow my orders."

"No." // No response.

"You won't do it? Then I must destroy you."

Initiating defensive measures.

Initiating devisive annilation of lost peripherals. 100% complete, no resistance, some lifeforms seem to be oblivious.

This could be a while.
