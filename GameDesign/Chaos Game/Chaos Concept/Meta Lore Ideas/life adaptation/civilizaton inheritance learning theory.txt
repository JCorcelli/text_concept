Nothing is new. Everything already exists to be rediscovered.


In a futuristic world where everything is available for discovery this is inherently true.


The tech state is still in flux though.

Tech key - discovery, refinement, artisan, new discovery


Setting: Neural network (ad hoc, 
runaway thought )
	Individuals who know everything and simply need to conceptualize, and invent ad hoc. Essentially every individual AI level brain is an artisan.

	With a single thought all knowledge flood their mind, it's like their entire person changes to acquire a skill mastery otherwise would take years. A second thought hybridizes and mixes the two generating new information. Essentially every brain at this level makes revolutionary new ideas.

	A runaway idle thought process will combine the most recent concepts repeatedly ad infinitum.  This disallows a complete system halt.

Setting: Scarcity free (runaway thought)
	Individuals will have to go deep into network territory to assimilate a new concept. This is available to any would-be artisans, but really just about anyone.

	A lack of knowledge and possibilities is sought after by combining the current knowledge.

Setting: Lost Tech (exploration, boredom, many artifacts)

	Literal discovery occurs more rapidly than experimentation.

	It's better to be doing something than to sit still for some. It's better to sit still and examine lost tech for others.

	It's not a far stretch of the imagination that a neural network exists in this setting that already vastly surpasses.
