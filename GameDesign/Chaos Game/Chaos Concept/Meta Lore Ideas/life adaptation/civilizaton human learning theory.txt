Tech key
discovery (t1) - rare but valuable part of environment
refinement (t2) - built with simple tools and knowledge
artisan (t3) - built with skillful use of refined tools
new discovery - discover tools to be mundane but valuable parts of civilization
	
Human-based generational learning (theory) - relies on brain and education
	first gen - discovery
	second gen - enjoy
	third gen - compete
	fourth gen - regress
	(repeat)
	
human-based micro-ecology of tech
	false assertion: every year is a gen (reality may be 4 - 20 years)
	within 3 years they'd reach t3, the first artisan and imitators appear
	on the 4th year, a regression, artisan envy
	the artisan is bound to uplift or evacuate their current society at the cusp of invention
	
	teach the next several generations a false assertion: new discovery (refined tools), civilization
