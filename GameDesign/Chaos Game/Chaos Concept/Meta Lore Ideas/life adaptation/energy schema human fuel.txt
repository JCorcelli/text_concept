I'm going to flesh out the organic and earth-like system and consider how it'd translate at the bottom.

power source (energy)
	light - highest speed capacity of space
	matter - organics are easily constructed on a molecular scale
	exotic matter (non-organic) - impossible to make, but easy to use
	psychic (subspace) - an exotic meta energy that surpasses light in speed
	dim'not - a meta force that surpasses logic, aka godlike.

organic life fuel (food)
	nutrient (catalyst) | poison (kills)
	light (most abundant free energy)
	
	food (aka lipid, stored energy)
	

tech free (t0) - anywhere
	minerals
	light - energy from star
	
	
environment / climate dependent
	hydrogen - 99% of a star, and all matter
	various atoms based on temperature
	
discovered (t1) - rare part of environment
	Earth-like
		wood - burn
		oil (old wood) - burn
		gas - combust
		chemical - combust, spark
		lightning
		sociable, tamed animals
	
	misc
	paradise planet (built)
	corrupted (by tech)
	
tool (t2) - built with simple tools and knowledge
	electricity (simple metallic objects)
	wheel (artisan)
	fuel (chemical refinement)
	heavily salted food
	
artisan (t3) - built with skillful use of refined tools
	
	liquid storage - biofuels and chemicals
	
	battery - stored electricity

dark civilization, human (c1) - passing down the refined tools (like a job level up), no written history or genetic knowledge
	req: mundane and refined language + memory (stored knowledge)
	post scarcity - storage
	

refined c2
	fire/cooking tools - heated food
	crafting tools - more tools, art
	
artisan c3
	cooked food - taste, health, surplus power, de-evolution (flatter teeth)
	
	etc?
	
golden civilization, human (g1) - compulsively recorded history, 
	req: information is mundane

refined g2
	energy is over-abundant (evolution is outpaced)
	energy storage is somewhat refined, safer and less costly use

artisan g3
	all forms of available energy and matter are detected, but some are useless
	new conceptual energy is devised
	
future civ, human (f1) - good and bad outcomes
	really fat people - selfish people store all the energy they can
	really crazy people - self-important people lose all desire for energy and convert the human race to return to nature
	psychic powers - some freak chance mutations enable psychic energy manipulation
	becoming gods - meta energy (like dim'not), or a full conversion out of the physical realm
	miserly - using highly advanced technology to make a new scarcity free civilization, and gathering all the power of hydrogen and light from stars
	exotic matter - discovery of untold power, resulting in all imaginable technology advances and a power source more abundant than light
	
Template
	before c1 (aka t1) the alien race wouldn't be perceptible
	the most abundant/ easiest form of any tech becomes desirable
		eg matter radiation is better than light radiation (it's all UV)
	a race can redefined 'bio' or 'organic' to exclude carbon and oxygen, but this eludes human understanding of biology. So other forces such as 'psychic' and exotic matter play a role.
	
	dim'not seeps out from the void, discovering dim'not is akin to becoming god and escaping civilization
