I've got this itch. It's culture prehistory, mostly unknown.  But the thing is in the old history, humans wouldn't outright kill just anyone, special cases would require a land grab with a higher power (religion), and they called it excommunication.  

Now I imagine the prehistory. Every ostracized individual would inevitably split off because their chance of survival under fire from humans in groups is zero.  Humans are known as pursuit predators because they're vindictive assholes. An individual would not only have to leave, to escape persecution, they'd have to gamble with the possibility they'd never find a safe place to live outside the original environment or they'd have to be even more dangerous alone than they were while trying to stick with the tribe mentality.

The fact is, 
sticking in tribes makes you weak?
we can't leave the planet?


Now mention the ice man case. A homicide in prehistory. In 2017 an expert Inspector determined he was 45 years old, went down to a village, fought someone, and went back up to a mountain, and got shot sometime after eating a cooked meal.

The ice man thought he was dangerous.


religion as a vaccine, without it we believe just about any asshole
