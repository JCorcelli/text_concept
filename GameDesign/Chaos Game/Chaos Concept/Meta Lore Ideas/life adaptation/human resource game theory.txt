instinct often wroks against the best possible outcome because rather than the best outcome later, we want the best now.

humans who fight for a resource they want have an animal's instinct, that's to say, 

the resource goes to the animal with the greatest advantage

but then there are more advanced strategies from game theory



Compete for resource
	1. greater advantage - the animal with merit will earn the resource
	2. Ally advantage / prisoner's dilemma, ally and betray your allies
	
Eliminate the resource
3. war of attrition - the animal who needs resources the least can wait out everyone else, even to their own detriment
	a prevent acquisition
	b destroy the resource
	c attack competitors
	
The best possible outcomes
Share
	Equal Shares - Everyone ignores eachother and takes what they can
	
	Hierarchal - Everyone takes what they need, as determined by a resource controller
	
	Prisoner's dilemma - sometimes someone doesn't get the resource

Increase resource
	A competitor with greater advantage steps down, allowing the resource to be distributed.
