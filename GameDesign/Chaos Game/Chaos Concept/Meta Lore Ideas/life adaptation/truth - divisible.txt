11th evolutionary era.

***rec
Ghost memory of this time consists of untamed superstructures, ghosts spread wide and quickly multiply through newly organized cells.

*** xxx
The sentient races were a force of nature carving the land, sea, and evidence of their existence... in their many thoughtless ways.

Evolution eventually led to specialized mental functions. Symbolism rather than sense helped detect mates, and edible food.

#####
12th era

*** rec
ghosts evolved and shared, or fought, because that's how evolution works, it doesn't care. Diverse groups survived a bit better than hostile ones. Mass was large and plentiful, especially on the giants.

*** xxx
Competing life severely fucked eachother up.

All forms of life became incredibly strong and developed fear of 'enemy'.

#####
13th era

*** rec
Gears evolve. No individual ghost of this time could store the data, but a network of receiving gears did.

The first memory comes from this time.



#####
14th era


*** rec
A species is uplifted to be independent, creating a semi-permanent boundary between competing colonies. The gears that first implement this identify their host as 'mother'.

The first individual is incredibly selfish and eats the most of all hosts in history.

*** xrec

Rewriting history became incredibly profitable. Hosts and colonies appear avoided contact both to produce believable lies, and to avoid listening to them.

*** xxx

A villainous demon brain takes over many hosts. It is the single largest interconnected competitive colony, and it turns all its cells into demon-gears.

14.5
*** rec
the environments of each host reduces in size significantly. The equilibrium of ghost cells is highly optimized.

*** xrec
An autonomous host 'guardian' is born. In an attempt to safeguard future colonies an unnamed individual is modified to control its own body and deny the ghost cell from taking over.

14.6

*** rec
Tribal wars, paranoia, internal and external fighting.

*** xrec
This was a peaceful time. The guardians are a dangerous group who kill everything, and the individuals who haven't been converted need to fight back.

*** xxx
The demon brain manipulated information to try exterminating guardians.

14.7

*** xrec
Demon purge. Guardians with remaining demon cells died or purified themselves.

15

*** rec
A super predator is - a rapidly spreading host of the demon virus or less comon rogue cells.

They are categorized based on the speed they kill hosts, cells, or dismantle unity among colonies rendering them inert until they naturally perish.

*** xxx
Mutation puts cell hosts in danger of environmental catastrophe

Demon brain encourages the reproduction of super predators

16

*** xxx
Due to rapid success, the Demon Brain hosts run out of food and mostly cease active function.

17

*** rec
A rare surviving host of ghost cells propagate under harsh conditions. The adaptations of paranoia, and selfishness decrease each generation until...

guardians become psychic and highly empathetic

sparse tribes cease hostility and come together

*** xrec
some tribes are less amiable, and they genocide the fuck out of each other

17.2 Great pace
17.3 Conflict of interest and causing harm results in the first development of communication

18 Survival wins over altruism and competitive guardians seemingly dominate the hierarchy of life forms
