Earth
water: Formula (H2O), poison - cyanide
temp rarely freezes water at equator, never boils

atmosphere: Oxygen (O2) 22%, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ozone, argon, and helium
100 air pressure at sea level

oxygen's evolution: atmosphere used to be CO2 and nitrogen before photosynthesis. The organisms then died.
Lifeforms that reverse the process by breathing came later.

Mercury
atmosphere: sodium potassium
 these two things explode in water...


Venus
carbon dioxide with minor amounts of nitrogen and trace amounts of nitrogen, helium, neon, and argon
CO2 oceans?


Gas Giant (Jupiter, Neptune)
 hydrogen and helium, methane
 water: liquid hydrogen 'metal' core
 
Rings
 ammonia, ice
 
Jupiter's moons
 Titan: 
 atmosphere: 98% nitrogen
 water: ethane, methane
