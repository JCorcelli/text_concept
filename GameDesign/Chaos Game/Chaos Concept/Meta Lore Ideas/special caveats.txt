conquering planets
	race will employ nearly permanent terraform to destroy or dominate a planet's ecosystem. This is both a natural victory and invasive antagonism.

character meta
	a player's experience will contain knowledge above the 'average' skill level of the npc's. This allows the separation of casual player, resembling npc, and power gaming players.
	
godhood meta
	a player controlled godlike alien will often wield knowledge and manipulative powers bordering on exploitative. Empowered characters can't help power gaming.

war
	demolishing planets and universes to end all reality is a naturally occurring process. Threat narratives create war. Learning how to blow up a parallel dimension will trigger what exists there to attack first!
	
respawning
	whether it's 
	a planet
	you as a character
	you as a god
	the universe itself
	
	stuff needs to come back somehow! a spawning system must persist.
