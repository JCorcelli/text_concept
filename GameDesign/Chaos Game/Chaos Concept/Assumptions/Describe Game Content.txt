I'm a ? (Nobody cares)

I build stuff. 
human standard: twigs and mud piles
	animal bone points
	sharp rocks.


	
	
construction properties ( use exclusive arbitrary resource piles)
	eg.
	construct mats
	organic (food)
	art / research grade material, 
	refinement - atoms, alloys
	


I can make modular 2-d objects that fit into the chunks. I call it minitech.
sky limit

interfaces
	sky limit. Graphics programming though.

microverses (from a planet)
	# Can be upgraded with house furnishing and called a home.
	# Can be destroyed by damage taking place in its macroverse.
	
	hideout : A modular chunk without an outer sprite. Can be revealed, 
	
	house : At least one dedicated spawn point and a roof. Can be attacked directly.
	
	tunnel : connects two positions
	
	portal : connects to one other portal
	
	microverse / micronexus : a contained nexus with all the capabilities of the world outside
	
	(smaller)
	"metaphysical" systems
		mini games, interfaces
		micro games, idle game windows
	
macroverses (from space)
	(smaller)
		planet
	
	space
	
	(bigger)
		d-Rift ...dimensional rift... some things should be indestructible

pocketverses
	# self-contained
	indestructible, unless reality is altered
	
tech /
	Microverses
	Civilization
	Etc. ( Research, sky limit )
	
outfit / augment the PC
	change color / shape
	expand usefulness
	expand power

	
I build stuff that can destroy stuff.

equip /aug the PC
	tools
	
	weapon types
		improvised
			tools... low damage, high pain, easy to recover
		simple
			... high damage, lasting effects
		ver dead weap
			heavy force... death and dismemberment
		weaponized
			science
			
			
I discover
	all the above
Then I build to entertain myself
	useless things in early stages will outpace the starter item efficiency
	eg
		binary electronics replaced mechanical calculators
		
		medicinal herbs replaced alcohol and endorphine stimulation
		
	and thus atomizers can replace giant trash compactors for cubing things
	
	a lot of useless stuff wastes a lot of time, and that's all it does. The best
