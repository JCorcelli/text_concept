I think a story game could work if it foxused on "save states" for sandbox time

the save state creates a sandbox - no goal, restriction, or benefit to your actions other than potential discovery

a checkpoint in story - doesn't require to author to think any harder

a sandbox moment is basically the winding down portion of these plot driven games forced by the player

so in other words, a sandbox moment is just a save point, where you can break the plot, or die, and not affect the outcome in any meaningful way.

A story game that punishes in the normal way may cause the player to lose a ton of time and miss the plot... that's an option, but idk.
