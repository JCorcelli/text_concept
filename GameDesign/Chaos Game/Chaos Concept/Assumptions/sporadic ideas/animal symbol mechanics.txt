This is the idea that I could set an intention to behave like an animal.

Game 1 you play as a bunny

I can reference the bunny's innate actions with the bunny symbol. It'll avoid contacting targets and stick to quickly dart between hiding spots.

By dragging it into something it'll try to hide in it or sniff. Somewhat passive.

lie: bunnies can be aggressive. bunnies aren't really that stealthy, although they have quiet back feet.



? Cat
In contrast if I use a cat symbol it's innate action is to stalk when around targets and scan. Dragging it into something makes it break open or pounce. Somewhat aggressive.

lie: cats are timid. cats don't understand "inside" as well as a bunny.

difference? cats can swipe at things, cats can fall gracefully. bunnies can't.
