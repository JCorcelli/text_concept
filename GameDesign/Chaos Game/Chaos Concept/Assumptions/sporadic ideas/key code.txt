[don't know if this is really relevant]

My current method of determining button presses is ...

having a utton named after its keycode... i could have just checked the keycode. 

I have a bunch of buttons that SHOULD be renamed to their function, rather than the key, so a user will understand intuitively.

I should prevent single button presses from activating multiple things, don't know if I do.
