A "throw" effect which uses physics

problem: 
	auto-moves to true target
	solu; break the movement and set the true target point when it ends
	
alternate mechanics abound:
	higher climbing
	walking on walls
	gravity shifting
	flying
	teleporters
	jump/ super far jumping
	fast travel (on-rail)
	smashing the player with BIG THINGS will also incur physical throwing
