Where do you get all the materials?

Interaction
	workstations should handicap the user for the enormous boost in productivity
		eg building an engine doesn't allow you mobility to hide in a corner while carrying a huge metal chassis
		
		owning a store advertises when the owner is in it, for thieves to go elsewhere
	
Item Form

	continue session... like when I use backup to continue one item, but with multiple
		needs a close all option then
	
		probably won't be obvious how nice this is until the actual usage matters
		
		There's also the likelyhood that I can and will save a 3d building interface like a dungeon.
			
Saving:
	open UIs
		If i'm actually saving a list of open 2d graphics: the position, rotation, and stack position will matter
	
	more data to track:
		o last selected preference
			but nothing's coded to follow it
			
		favorite items
			like... marked, easier to find than normal
			could just use the current save list
			
		
		inventory / vs / build
			inventory sounds limited. On the other hand, a teleporting device isn't.
			
			I can save an inventory when I know for sure what it is.
				Like... how abstract should it be. How much micromanagement?
			
		using / vs / equipping
			I can use one thing. I equip clothing, like an inventory bag.
