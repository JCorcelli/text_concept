SUMMARY
With the generic list abilities I don't have a lot I need to do.

A selected item is queued for action (Wait for USE message)

1  CATALOGUE
	
	A catalogue instances an object from a premade set and places it in an unsorted order during build.
	
	The item is clicked and sends a message with its name, name reaches the creator by default.
	
2  INVENTORY
	inventory items pass their name and action when dragged in/out, drop, select
	
	an item dragged in is equivalent to picking one up off ground in any rpg
	
OBJECT LIST IN GUI
Req.
	catalogue items are presorted, and object roots are named
	
Goal
	Won't require a creator of strings.
