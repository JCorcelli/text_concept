three kinds of message rigs
1
group hub. {onConnect, onMessage,delegate,variables}, is parent of...
	game object send/listen
	radio object message

2	
static hub. {onConnect, onMessage, delegate, variables}, is static
	may be used to introduce variables

3
hook object. to static hub {send ping, store target object}

target listener object. to static hub {connect on ping, connect on start, [message,delegate,variables]}
	behaves as hub to hooks
