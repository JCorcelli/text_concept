BOIL DOWN
DETS creator.list has many methods, better check the interface exposed in GenericListBuilder

	have item select set
	know when I select (a callback will let scripts rest)
	know what I select
	- select by search method
		
GENERIC LIST IN GUI
	Goal
		
			
	##progress
		mar 27
		list
			use reference to item preference saves
				o add
				o delete
				use... eg load
			
		
		o Make a generic menu list
			o display a list, string select and say "OK" to perform action
		
		mar. 20 2018 the creator connects by taking a node.list reference. 
		It can spawn an instance and immediately go to work.
		
		---
		prototype done, highlight and select
		
		vertical scrollbar, 
			reflects window, list, element size (any order). 
			moves browser-wise vertically. 
			updates continually while focused.
		
		(GUI BASIC) extra: discovered mask. added group selection.
		
		Unity buttons are dumb.* Can't drag out without clicking them.
		
		can drag the window
		
		a string search
		
		xx the ability to drag strings... Try to be practical now. See HSCDrop
			
	DoneList
	{##########
	The list will auto sort until told otherwise.
	
	menu activity to load preference
	user press i
	i item menu: select one form:  spawn / close menu
	spawn form: select load / close form
	load list: select element 
	
	
	think "" so far I can reuse what I've added to the forms/loading menu for just about anything. Right up until I reference the Spawnables, no doubt.
	
	
	problems:
	hub needs to wait for one to close before opening another
	now the damn buttons break due to some subsequent animation glitch, when I turn gameobject off (multiple animations)
	
	Manager/God Class
	o need to create the list, and the thing making it can control it all. 
	o maybe check if list is open var, dereference it then.
		node references hub, so if I care I can check that
		
	When I click the X, the list tries to close, but it should signal that it's done. 
		The HUB
			Thus it's safe to close.
		
		
	aaaah
	 or 
	x set the script scrollTarget (doesn't it select?)
	x open a new list with similar names (windows ver, guarantee not much space)
	
	next order: 
	o auto sort? I should let the player move stuff if it doesn't.
		decision in the making
	
	o search for similar strings in the list, 
	o select to force it to scroll (the way it works)
	
	o optimizing: Could setactiveFalse the objects that aren't visible in large lists, now that I know when they'd be visible. Won't that mess up the drag scrolling?
	
	
	
		generic list builder populate
			generic list only cares about displaying strings
			add/delete element
			
			the interpretation of what a string is will vary
		
		The group selection easily knows what has been clicked on, 
		
		
		Something parallel (it can be scratched up)
		o make list
		> access builder
		o Create list
		o populate list - everything I'll need to know a thing
		> access group selection: check selection
		o add/ - 
		
		o delete/ (delete key? Probably shouldn't without an undo, separate element could save the deleted string, but the ACTUAL object would have to be loaded)
