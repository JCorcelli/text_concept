	There's Scene Data - "persistent" objects in a scene.
	
	There's CustomPreferences Data - reusable, exists, but doesn't load without committal

issues with gameplay:
	PREFERENCES
	Pretty much done, and almost a no-brainer. Preferences would be like a new game+ feature.
	
	DUNGEONS
	REUSING SAVED DESIGNS
	pro if a design is particularly complex it'll be easy to reuse
	con if an RTS feel was the goal
	
	AUTO SAVING 
	pro in single player / creator modes, never lose progress
	
	the world HUB should auto save
	the dungeons only have one true state, and 
	
	
initially accepted credence:game should autosave changes over time
		
	save (with timed auto-saving)
		I force a backup save manually, and load the backup manually (shift S / L, preferably load from a menu)
		
		? load the autosave on play
		
		
		
SPAWN/ITEM/SAVE ongoing

	o now there's a saved preference, for checking recent save. and a selected preference for item selection
	
	
	Faulty pref bug: It was buggy, but that's all done. 
	
	Made a single custom item appear in game and save all its preferences. The menu affecting gameplay just right.
		o i set up a prototype graphic with "unity buttons"
		o I made it look cooler, and it stays on screen because adv. physics
		
		o script the buttons to change an actual undeployed item,
		o save it
		
		o an item menu to open (only 1 item atm)
		
		load it in game
		
		deploy it in 3D
			o The stupid animation and "click" on a button aren't 1:1, click is called on release, and only if the button is there (released fast enough, if the animation vanished). 
			o SCRIPT MADE TO OVERCOME! Can also force hold. Went back immediately and fixed bugs.
			
	o saving preferences from a form
		o PUT TEXT ON THE FORM ON LOAD
	
	custom item menu prototype

	saving the game - means saving the stats
	
	TESTING
	E#####
	o test dynamic gui interface in testing chamber. 
		*it will be novel and annoying each difference, like anything new, but doesn't really seem important now
	
	o try a 3d with a window pop
		o make a window pop-out (or appear) when I select the object, 
			I can make a whole stack of my rb interface appear, looks fine
		o or a single part of the object? single window. 
		x or a 3D tool widget/handle (case specific)
		
	try an organized 2d
		FOR SANITY AND DEBUGGINGs, also, 
	... make it work
	
	E######
	
	
	o I want to place a pre-made scene, and enter it. 
	o The scene will be saved (temp or otherwise)
	
	o I want multiple saved scenes I can load at runtime
		current limitation are the number of scenes. Limited memory space would make this harder.
		
	This of course requires 
		o a virtual scene # the default scene(s) already there
		o a list of items to be spawned per instance # in the scene
			eg
			o Dict string scene instance name : List spawned items
				<- interface to save the current scene instance
					? keyboard's ok for starter, likely to interfere with special actions later though. maybe the F- keys are better
	---
	
	o ass to spawned items
	o I can save the parameters in the ExitS class into the spawned items list (with many duplicates), one found in every dungeon. Or custom preferences dictionary
	
	o save ass spawned items, see save
	
	o save (vanilla) s/l saves loads
	
	o now theor. I can spawn an(s) exit	
		x {select item}
		o shift click (set some location, in this case the generic cursor center)
		x {future: walk on it for parameter interfaces}
		 spawn building (enter key)
		
		
	o removed dungeonvar inventory (fake) and cycle inventory (fake)
	o set up 
	DungeonSave
	and DungeonSaveClasses
	
	O Made shift a stationary hold. for ambulant climber 
		qe o some way to select an item in the inventory.
		enter o use the item
		
		
		o an inventory.
		o 1 any item list can be in dungeonvars
			it's not really safe, but it is persistent
