	setups / potential


(new) set goals
	location zoning and terrain can determine if areas are attacked or completely devoid of challenge. Which leads to a more role diversity.

merit based game
	hard limitation: Traverse on foot. No combat. Non-lethal deterrents.

	assumption: Construction is limited to predictable flat designs and stairs. Could resemble a house.
	
	setups that meet limitations include
	
	Potential: Low. Exceptional maze designs for beginners to observe.
	
	Easy counter: the blueprint
		
	t1 skill
	room (floor) > wall > storage > treasure
	blueprint > building > explore map
	trap - deterrent > teleporter, safe pit
	
	LOS checking - maze

	Dungeon t1 build instructions
		1  Add/Remove room
			Add must connect
			Remove must not break connection
		2  Add/Remove wall
			An open wall is a LOS check
		3  Teleportation and any other attributed furnishing takes up one whole room by itself
		
		4  Make a blueprint even if not originally referenced
		
		5  Finish Vault has a one way exit, there must be a finish
		
		6  Finish once to enable the vault's storage
		7  Items dropped are stored in vault on exit
		
	t2 skill
	door > lock > key
	
	Dungeon t2 added build instructions
		7  Add/Remove Door
			a door must open, or have a key
			An open door is a LOS check
			A closed door blocks LOS check
	
	t3 skill
	power > electronic devices > safe electronic deterrents 
	
	
	
	
	Map
		an explored map would just have to jot down where you've been
		
	Blueprint
		a blueprint could cover the entirety of the design for this type of dungeon

	
	##### GAME GOALS
	efficiency of construction - original expense vs wage potential. Assume everyone gets the same opportunity.
	
	workspace rep. - this is where wage gets earned, so you spend time here
	layout - goal of your design, ease of use, protection, comfort?
	transmission of goods - workspace sales ought to be front loaded, cargo is always the vault
	value of goods - hmm xxxxx
	theft protection - nobody's going to bulldoze the place, they can still steal for merit
	

competitive microverse
	Choose: Dungeon, Platformer, TD

	Monster Lair(Dungeon)
		a dungeon + monsters
		an unexplored Monster Lair can easily be far too deadly to risk.
		
		Limitation(s): LOS checks, irregular blueprint
		
		assumption:
			this would be the more common dungeon because it can be a puzzle 
			
			good for a vault
			
			could involve raids
			
			there's a discrepancy between techo - muto, and everything between is gray

		Potential: 
			Monster Harvesting req. biome of monster type
				Mutant
				Undead
				Inclimate weather
		
		Easy counter: monster knowledge, high power weapons
		
		##### GAME GOALS
		monster behaviors can be used in place of robotic defenses (well there you go)
	
	Platformer
	Speedy traversal, harder techniques, allow for impossible requirements and skill block 
		Limitation(s): no LOS, obvious Trap, no Map
		Potential: non-combat performance testing of advanced technology (parkour)
		
		assumption:
			flying mobs are too good
			
			may be very decorative and resemble a dungeon
		
		Easy counter: skill, precision jumping
	
		##### GAME GOALS
		speedrun - completion time
		secrets - unique item spawns???
	
	tower defense (TD), heavy weaponry
		Limitation(s): scale of danger, safe zones, transparency (obvious map)
		
		assumption:
			This is a massive fortification for a planet
			
			a house might have a guardian, which makes it a Tower Defended zone
			
			but a tower defense can be devastating
		
		Easy counters: sneaking, sabotage
	
		##### GAME GOALS
		Game Installment - team defensive location
		Exploitation - fortifying lawless land
		
And...	
other stuff 

	vault banking? 
	Loot spawns? 
	
	Exploited zone - resources
	
	moving objects (monsters), danger
	
	player skill is foreknowledge, ability
	pc skill is usually earned over time, grind
	
Destruction? Verse notes.
	miniverse destruction closes the dungeon.
	
	world-based destruction might break it
	
	destroying the macroverse would kill everyone
