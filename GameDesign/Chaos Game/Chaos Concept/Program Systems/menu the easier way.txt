Probably a better way to handle menus in a hierarchy.

There's a start menu. 
	Only one menu of this type can be open.
	

For each menu. 
	Focused elements.
	Shallow child hierarchy, a single sub-menu takes focus.
	When this opens a menu, this must close.
	The start menu should be easy to reach, within 3 cancels or a restart.

pseudo:

@ any menu
goto 1a

reveal 1, reveal 1a

search backward (assume the menu goes deep)
	if I'm at 1a, do nothing
	
	if I'm at 1, open 1a
	
	end of search
	
	
	reveal 1, reveal 1a
	

menus
