If actions would generate data...
	Fame ( scoreboard )
		basic stats
			beauty - clothing
			strength - displayed carry ability
			intellect - crafting skill
				minutia
			wealth - stuff seen from inventory
			
		renown
			positive action
	
	Nexus - 
		Generally a way to get to them even if you can't reach them.
		Micro - detected but not mapped since it can be turned on/off
		
	
	Dungeon - 
		nexus rules, blueprint, danger, wealth spent, complexity
	
	
	Hideout (no data)
	House - 
		shared mapping by travelers, investigators, and merchants (they should get paid for discovery)
		Houses aren't hidden for long.
		
	
	Orders - I suppose, no important information can go on them if it makes a paper trail.
	
	Locking
		number lock : memory probing and paper copy
		key lock : key copies (losing key naturally voids the dungeon).
		meta lock : hacking or destroying, probably
