PROGRAMMING
using the new oo programming school of thought


OO Dynamic Communication 

Hub
	send/receiver A
	
	decorator
		decorator
			send/receiver B
	
A needs to communicate with B, the parent has a Hub which they both recognize and communicate in 
	c# they each subscribe to a delegate when active, and unsubscribe when inactive
	in other languages they may call a method which utilizes a list
	
Hub class methods
	delegate onConnect () - int gameObject
	delegate onMessage () - int int
	connection() - message, gameobject
	send() - channel, message
	
All that matters is the information is consolidated, it can be made safe, it won't take long to set up.
