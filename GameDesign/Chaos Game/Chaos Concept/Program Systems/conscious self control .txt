Thinking about mechanical systems.  The goal should be to move from dev to outsider quickly so it becomes a mundane part of development.

a short system like this can be daunting if I try to consciously retain it for long. That is the job of a computer, a number of small simple jobs.

outsider - every thing's mundane, passive, functional in appearance.

player - when I can affect it, it matters.

dev - it's a job list.

programmer - it's an algorithm.

checking for cover (player)

bunny
	hidden in box
	visible to light
	under cover


checking for cover (programmer)

bunny (scripts)
	each box has a rig, it is solid, it can be entered
	
	light sources are passed to a list
		each light source is tested against every visibility indicator
	
	cover has a collider
		each visibility indicator checks each cover

overview (dev, a too close look)
jerri (systemic check)
	light, sight
	box, seen
	canopy, alert status
	
... light, sight
	move direction, catch if coming to

	distance from nearest hiding spot

	check for close wall, then trace back to see if you can reach



outsider - A bunny is hiding from some woman.
