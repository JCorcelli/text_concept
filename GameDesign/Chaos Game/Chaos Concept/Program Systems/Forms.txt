literal forms with organized information visible on them

o 1. desktop metaphor (desk m.) with a piece of paper that turns
	saved preference / spawner
2. desk m. as individual property slips that turn
	for 3d instance

	
visually coded "properties" (eg Type A:Z teleport form) in-game. This increases the sink potential for purchasing multiple.

1 In terms of forms the type probably doesn't improve the item, but better items would be found on better types. Maybe they allow you to specify a novelty.

2 For eg color coded orbs, an obvious difference would be red:fire, blue:ice. But maybe some things not so obvious darkbrown:mud, darkbrown2:slush.

		
DoneList:
	ExitSForm""
	
	P problem: I'm thinking: "explicit navigation if I set every item when it's generated. OTHERWISE it'll look bad.
		OR write a script."
		
		
	S solution: updated save as to save everything. warns about overwriting. I could probably make this more clever
	
	o problem:
		1. a load button on the form is really strange.
		2. a save all vs save as is somewhat misleading
			remove the save row
			
		3. overwriting the autosave is dumb. 
		
			Well actually the autosave is the save I use. I should make DONE clearer.
