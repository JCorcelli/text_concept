# Minitech (this is a set of modular items that alter the way large constructions function). 
Probably going to just call them upgrades though.

	
	hideout : make a weak microverse literally anywhere
	 > tunnel : connecting exits
	house : make a weak spawnpoint under any shelter
		# requires race to be defined
	nexus : 
		vr - computer interface
		pocket - another reality
		micro - high tech hideout
		macro - discover you're not the center of the universe

	locking
		door : turn a wall into a door
		number lock : make a door that won't open
		key lock : make a door that really won't open unless it's broken into, or you're some kind of dungeon key master
		meta lock : make a meta door, very smart door
	comms
		radio : equip things with a radio
		screen : for the hard of hearing
		voice : for the hard of seeing
		telepathy : got a brain?
		
		
Standard Interface

Workspace Interface
	menu
	saving
	
	item designer
		saved preference (exp, memory)
		requisition form : tech inventory
		physical item kit : when you are a designer
	level builder
		saved schematics
		holo prototype 
		/ blueprint : basic measurements to auto-build level
		level builder : for direct level building
		world projection: depending on verse, topology you may be encroaching on others
